The song was featured on their debut album, The Sickness, which was released in 2000. It peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 10 on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe video for the song features the band performing the song in a rusted cellar-like room, inter-cut with footage of a young boy sitting in the same room. As the song progresses, the boy is revealed to be haunted by demon-like creatures.\n\nThe video makes extensive use of a visual effect commonly called &quot;fast-head,&quot; first seen in Jacob's Ladder.\n\nDisturbed is a rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired singer David Draiman.

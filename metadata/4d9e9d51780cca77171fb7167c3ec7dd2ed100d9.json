The vocal harmonies remind me CSN and CSN&amp;Y. \nThis CD contains the magnificent &quot;Woodstock&quot; composed by Joni Mitchell and covered by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. The 3 versions are so different and it's very strange that the most unknown band let it to #1 in Great Britain! A one hit wonder! \n\nRecommended to discover this beautiful band.\n\n1 A Commercial Proposition    \n2 Thoughts for a Friend    \n3 What We Say    \n4 And Me    \n5 The Brand New Tennessee Waltz    \n6 Mare, Take Me Home    \n7 My Lady    \n8 Road to Ronderlin    \n9 Tell Me Why    \n10 To Love    \n11 Woodstock    \n12 Ballad of Obray Ramsey    \n13 Blood Red Roses    \n14 D'arcy Farrow    \n15 Jinkson Johnson    \n16 Something in the Way She Moves    \n17 Southern Comfort    \n18 Scion    \n19 Colorado Springs Eternal  \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed  \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d9e9d51780cca77171fb7167c3ec7dd2ed100d9","amp;dn":"Matthew%5C%27s+Southern+Comfort...The+Essential+Collection%281997%29%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d9e9d51780cca77171fb7167c3ec7dd2ed100d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,158,157,81,120,12,202,119,23,31,183,22,124,62,199,221,46,209,0,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

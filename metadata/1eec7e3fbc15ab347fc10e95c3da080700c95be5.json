I'd lie in bed listening for the ticks. Of course, I never once heard the tick-tock, rather, the odd gurgle or trump. So what is a bodyclock? What's the best way to keep it in check? \n\n\nHorizon looks at our internal mechanism... the thing that sends us to sleep, makes us feel hungry, makes us... well... tick. It does so by running through a day in chronological order, explaining that, really, when our body 'speaks', we should really listen.\n\nThe advice will veer from advising you have a nap in the afternoon (or, in sciencespeak, a &quot;microsleep&quot; or maybe, taking part in some competitive sport in the evening. It all depends on what type of person you are.\n\nWe also find out (which I'm clearly about to spoil here) that you are much more likely to have a heart attack in the morning, than at any other time of the day. Also, if you sport sunglasses in the afternoon, you'll sleep better at night. Naturally, you'll look like an arrogant dick end. Still, it should be fun finding out why these things are true.\n\n\nThe answers to these questions lie in the secret world of the biological clock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eec7e3fbc15ab347fc10e95c3da080700c95be5","amp;dn":"Horizon%3A+The+Secret+Life+of+Your+Bodyclock+--+%40+%7BMW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eec7e3fbc15ab347fc10e95c3da080700c95be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,236,126,63,188,21,171,52,127,193,14,149,195,218,8,7,0,201,91,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

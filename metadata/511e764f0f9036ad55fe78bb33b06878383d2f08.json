In a rapidly changing world can traditional art survive? What meaning does it still have?\n\nPart 2. African Art\nGriff Rhys Jones continues his quest to find traditional art in remote places by travelling to West Africa. Antique carvings from the region can fetch millions of pounds, but what makes a piece 'authentic', and are they still being made? Is there such a thing as pure African art?\n\nGriff starts his investigation in the Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali where the Dogon people have used their carvings and sculptures as a spiritual tool to help them survive. Can belief in the power of these objects withstand the march of modernity? In a revelatory journey which ends in Accra, the capital of Ghana, Griff learns that the passage of history and modern realities have had a surprising influence on invention and creativity in contemporary West Africa.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at MVGroup)\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid also available at forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:511e764f0f9036ad55fe78bb33b06878383d2f08","amp;dn":"BBC+Hidden+Treasures+of+2of3+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"511e764f0f9036ad55fe78bb33b06878383d2f08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,30,118,79,15,144,54,173,85,254,120,187,51,176,104,120,56,61,47,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

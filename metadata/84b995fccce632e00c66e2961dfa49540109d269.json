George Djorgovski from Caltech\n* Workload: 83 lecture videos, which may be 20 to 30 minutes in length\n* Taught In: English\n* Subtitles Available In: English\n\n\n== About the Course ==\n\nThis class is an introduction to the modern extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, i.e., the part of astrophysics that deals with the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole, and its major constituents: dark matter, dark energy, galaxies, quasars, large-scale structure, and intergalactic gas. It will cover the subjects including: relativistic cosmological models and their parameters, extragalactic distance scale, cosmological tests, composition of the universe, dark matter, and dark energy; the hot big bang, cosmic nucleosynthesis, recombination, and cosmic microwave background; formation and evolution of structure in the universe; galaxy clusters, large-scale structure and its evolution; galaxies, their properties and fundamental correlations; formation and evolution of galaxies; star formation history of the universe; quasars and other active galactic nuclei, and their evolution; structure and evolution of the intergalactic medium; diffuse extragalactic backgrounds; the first stars, galaxies, and the reionization era. It corresponds to the Ay 21 class taught at Caltech.\n\n== Recommended Background ==\n\nThis class assumes at a minimum a prior knowledge of astronomy at a good mid-undergraduate level (e.g., Ã¢â‚¬Å“Astro 101Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for science majors, not Ã¢â‚¬Å“Astro 1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for poets), knowledge of physics at a comparable level, and math at a level of calculus or higher. A substantive Wikipedia article is about at the right level.\n\n== Suggested Readings ==\n\nThe class, including the assigned readings, is designed to be self-contained, the following books would be useful for students desiring to acquire a deeper and more substantive knowledge of the subject:\n\n- Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology: An Introduction , by P. Schneider /included in torrent/\n- Introduction to Cosmology by B. Ryden. /included in torrent/\n- Cosmology: The Science of the Universe by E. Harrison, Cambridge U. Press, ISBN-13: 978-0521661485 /not included in torrent/\n\nThese are also illustrative of the anticipated level of the class.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b995fccce632e00c66e2961dfa49540109d269","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Galaxies+and+Cosmology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b995fccce632e00c66e2961dfa49540109d269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,185,149,252,204,230,50,224,12,102,226,150,29,250,73,84,1,9,210,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

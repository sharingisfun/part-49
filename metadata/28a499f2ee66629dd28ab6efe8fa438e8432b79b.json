Lone files or several files can be gathered in the program window, where they can be encoded and then saved on the hard disk or burned onto a CD or DVD. Once saved onto disk, the encoded files are safe and can be optimally transported. It is also possible to store the files in a self-extracting EXE archive which can then be forwarded to friends or work colleagues. The recipients simply have to activate the files. After entering the correct password, the archives then extract and decode themselves automatically. \n\nPlease note: Ashampoo Magical Security 2 is also able to delete files to ensure their complete, non-residue removal from the hard disk ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ as whatÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s the use of the most sophisticated encoding system if, by using the appropriate program, the deleted originals can simply be recovered? \n\n\nNew in Version 2: with compression and Email dispatch\nIn the new version, Ashampoo Magical Security 2 doesnÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³t only offer a completely newly designed display and innumerably improvements in terms of detail.

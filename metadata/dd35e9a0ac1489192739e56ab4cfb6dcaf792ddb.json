Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, Daemon Tools virtual drive can be used to mount the image file, or PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named &quot;00000.m2ts&quot;. Once extracted, if you decide to save the movie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc.\n\nPlease Visit HD-R-US, they have the best AVCHD torrent...Leave comments so i can improve my next upload, or i should quit sharing =))\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd35e9a0ac1489192739e56ab4cfb6dcaf792ddb","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+BluRay+AVCHD+720+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd35e9a0ac1489192739e56ab4cfb6dcaf792ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,53,233,160,172,20,137,25,39,57,229,106,180,207,182,220,175,121,45,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The plot tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a loud, hyperactive, unpredictable, adolescent ninja who constantly searches for recognition and aspires to become a Hokage, the ninja in his village that is acknowledged as the leader and the strongest of all. The series is based on a one-shot that Kishimoto first authored in the August 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump.\n\nThe manga was first published by Shueisha in 1999 in the 43rd issue of Japan&amp;#039;s Weekly ShÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen Jump magazine and it is still being released with forty-four volumes. The manga would be later adapted into an anime produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex. It premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo network and the anime satellite television network Animax on October 3, 2002. The first series lasted nine seasons, while Naruto: ShippÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«den, a sequel of the series, began its first on February 15, 2007 and is still airing.\n\nViz Media has licensed the manga and anime for North American production. The Naruto anime debuted in the United States on Cartoon Network&amp;#039;s Toonami programming block on September 10, 2005, and in Canada on YTV&amp;#039;s Bionix on September 16, 2005. Naruto began showing in the United Kingdom on Jetix on July 22, 2006. It began showing on Toasted TV on January 12, 2007, in Australia, which features the Manga Entertainment TV version and the German-language dub opening, although it could be watched on Cartoon Network in 2006.[1]\n\nSerialized in Viz&amp;#039;s Shonen Jump magazine, Naruto has become one of the company&amp;#039;s best-selling manga series. As of volume 36, the manga has sold over 71 million copies in Japan.\n\nTwelve years before the events at the focus of the series, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked the ninja village Konohagakure. It raised chaos and slaughtered many people, until the leader of Konohagakure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Fourth Hokage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sacrificed his own life to seal the demon inside Naruto when he was a newborn.\n\nKonohagakure, however, regarded Naruto as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood. A decree made by the Third Hokage forbade anyone to discuss or mention the attack of the demon fox to anyone. However, this did not stop them from treating him like an outcast and as a result he grew up an orphan alone. However, that soon changed after Naruto graduated from the Ninja Academy by using his Shadow Clone Technique, a technique from a forbidden scroll that he was tricked into stealing, to save his teacher, Iruka Umino, from the renegade ninja Mizuki. That encounter gave Naruto two insights: that he was the container of the demon fox, and that there was someone besides the Third Hokage who actually cared for and acknowledged him. The main story follows Naruto and his friends&amp;#039; personal growth and development as ninja, and emphasizes their interactions with each other and the influence of their backgrounds on their personalities. Naruto finds two friends and comrades in Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, two fellow young ninja who are assigned with him to form a three-person team under an experienced sensei named Kakashi Hatake. Naruto also confides in other characters that he meets throughout the series as well. They learn new abilities, get to know each other and other villagers better, and experience a coming-of-age journey as Naruto dreams of becoming the Hokage of Konohagakure.\n\nThroughout all of the Naruto plot, strong emphasis on character development changes the plot, with very few things happening because of chance. At first, emphasis is placed on Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who are the members of Team 7. Later, Orochimaru, a criminal at the top of Konoha&amp;#039;s most wanted list, attacks Konoha killing the Third Hokage as an act of revenge. He also desires to acquire Sasuke Uchiha due to his powerful genetic heritage. Believing Orochimaru will be able to give him the strength needed to kill his brother Itachi, who destroyed all his clan, he goes to him. Naruto fights against Sasuke to make him return, but he fails. Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha for two-and-a-half years of training to prepare himself for the next time he meets Sasuke. After the training period, a mysterious organization called Akatsuki attempts to capture the nine powerful tailed beasts including begins the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox that is sealed inside of Naruto. Several ninjas from Konoha, including Team 7, fight against the Akatsuki members as well as Team 7 search for their teammate Sasuke.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b7d9ee9dc39f0ace4019a5dc5a225705a4a614","amp;dn":"Naruto+103-220+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b7d9ee9dc39f0ace4019a5dc5a225705a4a614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,183,217,238,157,195,159,10,206,64,25,165,220,90,34,87,5,164,166,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

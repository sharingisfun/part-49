As usual :)\n\nNext time any user logs in, they will be presented with a black screen. Nothing else. Just a black screen.\nWhenever the user clicks the mouse or presses any key on the keyboard, Windows will log out immediately!\n\n\n\nHere is how to remove it:\nRestart the computer and boot into Safe-Mode.\nOpen the Registry Editor ('regedit.exe'), and browse to this key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run\n\n(On Windows XP, the last path will be 'RunOnce')\n\nDelete the value named &quot;FUBAR ShutDown 2011 v2&quot;.\n\n\n\n/Ubehage\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe614579fd3c1259b4498610c3c21b9ea014c240","amp;dn":"FUBAR+ShutDown+2011+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe614579fd3c1259b4498610c3c21b9ea014c240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,97,69,121,253,60,18,89,180,73,134,16,195,194,27,158,160,20,194,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

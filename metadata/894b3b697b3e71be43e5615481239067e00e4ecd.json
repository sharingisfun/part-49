As it sits quietly in your system tray, you are just a couple keystrokes away from jumping to any web site with your favorite browser -- while you work in any program.\n\nVERY EASY TO USE\nJust highlight the site you want to go to, press the hotkeys you have assigned, and you are off.... Whether you are online and see a web site that does not have a convenient hyperlink to another site, you have a contact manager program where you like to store web site addresses, your e-mail client does not support HTML, or you just want to keep your bookmarks in a simple format (such as a plain text file viewable with a notepad or word processor), hyperlinks are now still easily accessible.\n\nENHANCE RESEARCH OR JUST HAVE FUN\nYou can also highlight text in any Windows-compatible program and then trigger the hotkey to see where on the Internet that word might take you. It can enhance serious research or just add a lot of fun to surfing the net. Web Site Express will also go to the domain part of any e-mail address: just highlight the e-mail address and it will take you to the domain for that e-mail account.\n\nHome Page- http://www.nstarsolutions.com/wse/\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894b3b697b3e71be43e5615481239067e00e4ecd","amp;dn":"Web+Site+Express+2.6.3+DC+05.12.2011+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894b3b697b3e71be43e5615481239067e00e4ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,75,59,105,123,62,113,190,67,229,97,84,129,35,144,103,224,14,78,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

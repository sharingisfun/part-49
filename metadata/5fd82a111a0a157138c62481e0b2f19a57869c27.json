A student of his, Tracy Flick (Reese Whiterspoon), tends to rub him the wrong way. Flick, a loner and ambitious girl, decides to run for class president. McAllister convinces football player Paul (Chris Klein) to run against her. His lesbian sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) joins the election after her girlfriend starts going out with Paul. During the campaigns, Tracy plays dirty, plying students with muffins and gum. Tammy adopts an anarchist attitude that the student body responds to. Paul has few skills to offer the position. Meanwhile, McAllister's going through a bad time with his wife. Written by Alejandro Frias\n\nTracy Flick is the most driven student at Carver High, who just happens to be having an affair with one of her teachers. Another teacher--Mr. McAllister--is having an affair with his wife's best friend. Student Elections are under way, when Mr. McAllister persuades football jock Paul to run against Flick for his own pleasure. Flick, of course, is mortified that Paul is even trying to compete. Tammy, Paul's lesbian sister who got dumped by her girlfriend to go with Paul, decides that running against her brother is the best revenge. Who will win the election this year?  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126886/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126886/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo:\nOptimized for AppleTV\nRuntime: 1:39:10\nCodec: H.264\n23.98 FPS\n640 x 272\n\nAudio:\nAAC, Stereo (L R), \n44.100 kHz\nEnglish\n\nConverted from AVI. original torrent: \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd82a111a0a157138c62481e0b2f19a57869c27","amp;dn":"Election+%281999%29+%5BAppleTV%5D+%5Bmp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd82a111a0a157138c62481e0b2f19a57869c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,216,42,17,26,10,21,113,56,198,36,129,224,178,241,154,87,134,156,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The band's musical style incorporates classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into hard rock and heavy metal. The orchestra is most famous for their Christmas-themed series of rock operas (Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, and The Lost Christmas Eve), for which they do an annual winter tour. Their other releases are based on historical themes (Beethoven's Last Night and Night Castle). Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which are complete with a full orchestra, a massive light show, lasers, dozens of pyrotechnics, moving trusses, video screens, and other effects that are synchronized to the actual music.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Orchestra is known for their incorporation of classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into rock and heavy metal music. They are listed under many genres, but mostly symphonic rock, progressive rock, neo-classical metal, and classical music. Three of their albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christmas Eve and Other Stories ( 1996 ), The Christmas Attic ( 1998 ), The Lost Christmas Eve ( 2004 ) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are based around Christmas themes. These rock operas, collectively known as the &quot;Christmas trilogy,&quot; remain their best-selling and most famous works.\n\nBoth in the recording studio and live, Trans-Siberian Orchestra uses a full orchestra, choirs, and a constantly growing and changing group of singers and musicians. It was founded and is produced and led by head composer and lyricist Paul O'Neill, alongside composer and vocalist Jon Oliva and guitarist and music director Al Pitrelli (both members of the progressive metal band Savatage), with co-producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Kinkel.\n\nThe Lost Christmas Eve is the fourth album by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It was released on October 12, 2004, and is the last album in their &quot;Christmas trilogy&quot;, with Christmas Eve and Other Stories ( 1996 ) and The Christmas Attic ( 1998 ) coming before it. All three albums, as well as their The Ghosts of Christmas Eve DVD, were featured in the The Christmas Trilogy box set.\n\n\nTrackList\n\n01 - Faith Noel\n02 - The Lost Christmas Eve\n03 - Christmas Dreams\n04 - Wizards in Winter\n05 - Remember\n06 - Anno Domine\n07 - Christmas Concerto\n08 - Queen of the Winter Night\n09 - Christmas Nights in Blue\n10 - Christmas Jazz\n11 - Christmas Jam\n12 - Siberian Sleigh Ride\n13 - What Is Christmas?\n14 - For the Sake of Our Brother\n15 - The Wisdom of Snow\n16 - Wish Liszt (Toy Shop Madness)\n17 - Back To A Reason (Part II)\n18 - Christmas Bells, Carousels &amp; Time\n19 - What Child Is This?\n20 - OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Come All Ye Faithful\n21 - Christmas Canon Rock\n22 - Different Wings\n23 - Midnight Clear\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFormato                          : MPEG Audio\nVersione del formato             : Version 1\nProfilo del formato              : Layer 3\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â                          : Costante\nBitRate                          : 320 Kbps\nCanali                           : 2 canali\nSamplingRate                     : 44,1 KHz\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nJoin www.nautilus-bt.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62e8bc18aacb6f19c897fcf9973bea8cb5ce2ac","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+Beethoven%5C%27s+Last+Night+%5BMP3+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62e8bc18aacb6f19c897fcf9973bea8cb5ce2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,46,139,193,138,172,182,241,156,137,127,207,153,115,190,168,203,92,226,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

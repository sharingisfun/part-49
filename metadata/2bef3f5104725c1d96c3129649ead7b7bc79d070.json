I feel they are very watchable and I know that there are better compressors out there but I like the simple route. Sorry about the slow upload, that's my lot in life. Will try and put out other seasons (I have them all) when there are one or two seeders of this season. Be Mad (but in a good way). - MC\n\nP.S.  Will try and get &quot;The Specials&quot; and Season 5 - 11 soon.\n\nLooking for S12 E10 - A Cabbage Sprouts in Brussels to complete the coloection. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bef3f5104725c1d96c3129649ead7b7bc79d070","amp;dn":"Good+Eats+S4+Season+4+MPG+%28VCD+Quailty%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bef3f5104725c1d96c3129649ead7b7bc79d070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,239,63,81,4,114,92,29,150,195,18,150,73,234,215,183,188,121,208,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

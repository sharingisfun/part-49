The Sincerest Form of Parody collects the best and the funniest material from these comics, including parodies of movies (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, From Here To Eternity), TV shows (WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Line, The Late Show), comic strips (Little Orphan Annie, Rex Morgan), novels (I, the Jury), plays (Come Back, Little Sheba), advertisements (Rheingold Beer, Charles Atlas), classic literature (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Lady or the TigerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and history (Pancho Villa). Some didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even try for parody, but instead published odd, goofy, off-the-wall stories.\n\nThese earnest copiers of MAD realized that Will ElderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cluttered Ã¢â‚¬Å“chicken fatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ art was a good part of MADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success, and these pages are densely packed with all sorts of outlandish and bizarre gags that make for hours of amusing reading. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“parody comicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are uniquely Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ catching the popular culture zeitgeist through a dual lens: not only reflecting fifties culture through parody but also being themselves typical examples of that culture (in a way that Harvey KurtzmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MAD was not).\n\nThis unprecedented volume collects over 30 of the best of these crazy, undisciplined stories, all reprinted from the original comics in full color. Editor John Benson (who wrote the annotations for the first complete MAD reprints, and interviewed MAD editor Harvey Kurtzman in depth several times over the years) also provides expert, profusely illustrated commentary and background, including comparisons of how different companies parodied the same subject.\n\nArtists represented include Jack Davis, Will Elder, Norman Maurer, Carl Hubbell, William Overgard, Jack Kirby, Dick Ayers, Bill Everett, Al Hartley, Ross Andru &amp; Mike Esposito, Hy Fleischman, Jay Disbrow, Howard Nostrand, and Bob Powell.\n\nCasual comics readers are probably familiar with the later satirical magazines that continued to be published in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s, such as Cracked and Sick, but the comics collected in this volume were imitations of the MAD comic book, not the magazine, and virtually unknown among all but the most die-hard collectors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a974fdec5f98b12de5184bdd2c56e0e44063495","amp;dn":"The+Sincerest+Form+of+Parody%3A+Best+1950s+MAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a974fdec5f98b12de5184bdd2c56e0e44063495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,151,79,222,197,249,139,18,222,81,132,189,210,197,110,14,68,6,52,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

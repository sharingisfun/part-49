And our group of people miss the train 'cause they went partying the night before. They get on a different train to catch up with their teammates and horror ensues. I researched real crimes that happen here in Eastern Europe and based it on that. This is as an intelligent horror film, It's got gore and it's got the stuff that makes it a horror movie, but it's also got a clever story people will enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79569a1cc7c4c13752280325e7d1e8f3b133d09f","amp;dn":"Train.2008.720p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79569a1cc7c4c13752280325e7d1e8f3b133d09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,86,154,28,199,196,193,55,82,40,3,37,231,209,232,243,177,51,208,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

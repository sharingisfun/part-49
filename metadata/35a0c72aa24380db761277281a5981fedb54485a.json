When the application opens you then simply go to the web page for the iplayer programme you wish to download and copy the address bar ie. http://www.bbc. etc. etc. You then post this address into the 'programme id' and then click download. You will then be asked where to save the file.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the programme either watch it on your computer (it is saved as a .mov file) or convert to dvd with the excellent convertxtodvd to watch on your television.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThere is actually an interesting arms race going on between the BBC and the software developer. You will probably find that after a month or two this software will not work anymore. This is because the BBC has found a way to block it. However, the software programmer knows what he is doing and within a day or two he will upload a new version of the software which will be fully functioning again. I will try and upload the new version when it comes on line so make sure you are downloading the latest version which has been uploaded. Alternatively you can go to the site which is highlighted first in my 'useful links' below where you can download the latest version yourself directly.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n\n\nUseful links:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://po-ru.com/projects/iplayer-downloader/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://po-ru.com/projects/iplayer-downloader/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4615339/ConvertXtoDVD_3.3.4.106e_And_Keygen_%5B1337x%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4615339/ConvertXtoDVD_3.3.4.106e_And_Keygen_%5B1337x%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3705425/Magic_Video_Converter_8.0.2.18_(The_Ultimate_Video_Converter)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3705425/Magic_Video_Converter_8.0.2.18_(The_Ultimate_Video_Converter)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a0c72aa24380db761277281a5981fedb54485a","amp;dn":"BBC+Iplayer+Downloader+%28DRM+Removal%29+-+Version+1.11+%28March+09%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a0c72aa24380db761277281a5981fedb54485a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,160,199,42,162,67,128,219,118,18,119,40,26,89,129,254,219,84,72,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

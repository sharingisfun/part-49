Handsome Mick fronted the band &quot;Tempest&quot;. One of the first metal recording artist to be signed, record, and tour all over the United States. Sales of over 100,000 units put Tempest and Handsome Mick on the radar, Handsome Mick left the CCM world in 1990 with a distaste for that industry. HMR is now known as one of the &quot;Godfathers&quot; of Christian Metal.\n\nIn 2004 he journeyed to Nashville to pursue a new music career. When Handsome Mick Rowe arrived in Nashville he had long hair, earrings, tattoos, and he looked like he would have fit in better in the metal head community than in the Nashville community. Walking out of all the downtown clubs with big name Country music stars (members of Muzik Mafia and others with his cowboy hat and attitude on. country/southern rock music fans would naturally think the 6 foot 4 giant a big star and mob him. It was during this time when someone took to calling him &quot;Handsome Mick Rowe&quot; because he looked like a combination of country rock star and a pro wrestler.\n\nIn 2004 his next break came. Pump Audio signed the artist to put his music on just about every cable network show you can imagine. That same year John &amp; Dino Elephante of Kansas took notice of his talents and released his first album with the band Nineteen88 entitled &quot;The Great American Rock &amp; Roll Spectacle&quot;. Within the next year he started touring with the rowdy Southern rock group, and sold nearly 50,000 copies of the debut. But it was still not the Southern Rock vibe he was looking for.\n\nNow Handsome Mick Rowe is still rowdy and doing it his way. Handsome Mick Rowe has no compunctions about being flat-out silly, which is good, since that silliness brings him a big novelty hit in &quot;The Beer Song (Hell Yeah),&quot; a song designed for drunken shout-alongs in sports bars. The debut also includes the Charlie Daniels Band classic &quot;Long Haired Country Boy&quot; &quot;The Beer Song &amp; U.S.A. The sessions include Hank Jr.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s steel wizard Mike Daly. Rednecks &amp; Longnecks plays to a rowdy audience, but the surprise is that the rowdiness is tongue-in-cheek and that Handsome Mick is musically clever, filling the record with big hooks and unbridled weirdness. - but it&amp;#039;s wilder and stranger than most contemporary country albums of the last few years, and a whole lot more fun, to boot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382e612726f5b93a1269d4566f75c5a3340da8f4","amp;dn":"Handsome+Mick+Rowe-Rednecks+%26+Longnecks-Skynyrd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382e612726f5b93a1269d4566f75c5a3340da8f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,46,97,39,38,245,185,58,18,105,212,86,111,117,197,163,52,13,168,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It supports plugins for all three\ntypes of Diablo II servers (chat, realm, game). To add a plugin simply add it to \nthe \\&quot;Plugins\\&quot; folder and it will be automatically loaded at application start. \nI have included all of the source code to RedVex and the plugins in the hope\nthat they will be useful to other developers.\n\nConnecting to Battle.net through RedVex is easy:\n\n\t1) Select \\&quot;Edit | Options\\&quot; and pick the realm you wish to play on.\n\t2) Select \\&quot;Edit | Realms\\&quot; then add a new realm, I called mine RedVex (doesn\\&amp;#039;t \n\t\tmatter though). Make sure it redirects to localhost. Pick the same\n\t\tvalue for offset as the realm you wish to play on.\n\t3) Select \\&quot;Proxy | Start\\&quot;\n\t4) Start Diablo II and pick the realm you added as the realm you wish to play on.\n\t5) You should now be able to connect and play using RedVex.\n\t\nWhen using the plugin manager to unload/load plugins be carefull not doing that while Diablo II is running, it might lead to misfunctions and realm down. (Maybe even cd-key or account ban)\n\nOptional command line arguments:\n\t-hide\n\t\tDoesn\\&amp;#039;t show the main window when you start\n\t-run\n\t\tAutostart proxy upon launch\n\nHomepage: www.redvex.net\nIRC: #redvex on irc.dal.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac06b696ec3042da23f731a8c7ebcc629e46010b","amp;dn":"RedVex+3+June+12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac06b696ec3042da23f731a8c7ebcc629e46010b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,6,182,150,236,48,66,218,35,247,49,168,199,235,204,98,158,70,1,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

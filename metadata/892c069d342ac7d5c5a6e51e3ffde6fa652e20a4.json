It is not a straight reissue of either 1962's &quot;Glorious Sound of Christmas&quot; or the 1964 follow up &quot;A Christmas Festival&quot; but rather a compilation of sixteen tracks pulled from the two LPs: eight from each.\n\n&quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;, &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sings&quot;, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot; are all from &quot;Glorious Sounds of Christmas&quot;. &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, &quot;We Three Kings&quot;, &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot;, &quot;O Tannebaum&quot; , &quot;Away in A Manger&quot;, &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;, &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, and &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; are from &quot;A Christmas Festival&quot; which, sadly, has never been released on CD in its entirety. So this is the only way to obtain the 8 &quot;Christmas Festival&quot; tracks short of finding an old LP copy.\n\nThe sound on all these vintage performances is wonderful and the playing - well, it is 1st class as you would expect from Ormandy and the Philadelphians' long and successful run with Columbia.\n\nPlease note: &quot;The Glorious Sound of Christmas&quot; is still available at budget price. In addition to the eight tracks listed above it also includes: &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;O Sanctissima&quot;, &quot;The Worship of God&quot;, &quot;O Come Little Children&quot;, &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot;, and &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;. You may want to purchase that CD from Amazon as well.\nThe Glorious Sound of Christmas\n\nThe four tracks from the &quot;A Christmas Festival&quot; LP which sadly have not yet found their way to CD are: &quot;For Unto Us A Child Is Born&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot;, &quot;Here We Go A Caroling&quot;, and &quot;I Wander as I Wander&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:892c069d342ac7d5c5a6e51e3ffde6fa652e20a4","amp;dn":"Philadelphia+Orchestra+Greatest+Christmas+Hits+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"892c069d342ac7d5c5a6e51e3ffde6fa652e20a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,44,6,157,52,42,199,213,197,166,229,30,63,253,230,250,101,46,32,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

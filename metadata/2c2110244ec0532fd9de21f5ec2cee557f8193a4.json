He visits one of the windiest places on the planet, walks into the centre of a man-made tornado and creates a 10-metre high whirlwind - made of fire!\n\nAlong the way he is part of a world first when he joins up with an American meteorologist called Reed Timmer and a bizarre vehicle known as The Dominator III. Their aim is to succeed in doing what no one has ever done before, fire a probe into a tornado to measure its speed where it is at its fastest - right next to the ground. As Reed explains, 'near the base of the tornado is one of the biggest mysteries of tornado science and it's also the most important to understand because those are the wind speeds... that cause all the destruction'. To put that right, Reed and his team take The Dominator into the middle of a real live tornado and attempt to fire a probe into the very heart of it.\n\nSIZE: 1039830972 bytes (991.66 MiB), \n\nDURATION: 00:57:34, \n\nAVG-BITRATE: 2408 kb/s\n\nAUDIO: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\n\nVIDEO: h264, yuv420p, 1280x720, 25.00 fps(r) (eng)\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mmh.vivaex.com/viewer.php?file=57378821137965048439.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mmh.vivaex.com/viewer.php?file=57378821137965048439.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mmh.vivaex.com/viewer.php?file=13621885022950342187.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mmh.vivaex.com/viewer.php?file=13621885022950342187.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2110244ec0532fd9de21f5ec2cee557f8193a4","amp;dn":"Wild+Weather+With+Richard+Hammond+S01E01+720p+HDTV+x264-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2110244ec0532fd9de21f5ec2cee557f8193a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,33,16,36,78,192,83,47,217,222,33,245,236,44,238,85,127,129,147,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

You can either wipe your hard drive and use this as your primary and only OS or you can partition your hard drive to dual-boot with Windows.\n2) You can use VMware to create a virtual hard drive and run windows along with Ubuntu simultaneously. You can either create the virtual machine using the iso or you can burn it to a dvd-r or cd-r and boot it from there.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHope you guys enjoys this and be sure to seed. I will be uploading more torrents once there are plenty of seeds.\n\nREMINDER:\n\nThis is the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu 10.10. If you are running on a 32-Bit system then this version will not work. I will be uploading the 32-Bit version soon.\n\nPEACE,\nAngelus\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27a6278804097c79babac634ac4bab06d67bbd2","amp;dn":"Ubuntu+10.10+64-Bit+iso+%7BAngelus1609%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27a6278804097c79babac634ac4bab06d67bbd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,122,98,120,128,64,151,199,155,171,172,99,74,196,186,176,109,103,187,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Or just VDU RITW1. \nEr, yeah.\n\nAnyway, this bundle of files is brought to you by\nDanfox Davies, self described furry &amp; Pirate Party \nUK Member (neither of which should you let alter \nyour judgement of said files, of Vulpine Designs \nUnlimited or of anything else related or unrelated \nto it) and Chief Executive Fox of Vulpine Designs \nUnlimited, which sounds far grander than it isn't.\n\nI hereby declare that I am releasing my work under\na Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, except for any\nitems including trademarks of other companies, in\nwhich case it's BY-NC-ND and a big reminder that \nsaid trademarks are copyright of and belong to their \nrespective companies, including the name 'LEGO' and \nits logo and so on being trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nIf you folks would be so kind as to visit my website\nat http://www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk , I would very much \nappreciate it. It takes a lot of time to create this\nwork, if you feel that's worth something please drop \nme an email and you can Paypal me. If enough people \ndo so I'll set up an automated system on my site.\nIf you want, you can commission me to design and/or make \nsomething unique for you, or you can buy one of our \npre-designed models.\nEven if you're skint or you don't think my work's \nthat interesting, please drop me an email with feedback\nto &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6d04030b022d1b18011d04030809081e040a031e430e02431806&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; .\n\nAnyway.\nA big compressed folder. Herein contained is\nVolume 1 of what is hopefully to become a regular\nthing: a veritable smorgasbord of design ideas \nbuilt in Lego, hours spent on each one, and now \nall set free into the wild yonder to roam the \ninterwebs and be eaten by a troll or something.\n\nIn your free goody bag (compressed folder) you get:\n*Folders. \nEach contains a weird Lego(R) design presented using:\n** A picture, in JPG or PNG format or both.\n** A CAD file. This will be in LXF format.\n** Another CAD file. This will be in LDR format.\n** A text file description/explanation.\nOccasionally:\n** Building instructions in ODG format and PDF format.\n(if I have gotten round to making them for that model).\n\n*This text file.\n*Creative Commons License.\n*Possibly some other things.\n\nA link to the download page for LEGO(R) Digital Designer\nis here: http://ldd.lego.com\n\nA link to the website for LDraw is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ldraw.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ldraw.org&lt;/a&gt;\nPlease note that files converted from LDD to LDraw are \nliable to missing pieces or unrecognised parts.\n\nNo warranty, implied or otherwise, is attached to any of these files.\nIf you want to get one of these things built for real WITH a warranty,\nplease go to www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk and read the Terms And Conditions \nat the bottom, and email me should you be inclined to go ahead.\n\nIt cannot be guaranteed that some sort of virus hasn't \nattached itself to this folder by now.\nIt is after all a folder circulating the intertubes by \nmeans of Torrent or possibly something else if someone's \nuploaded this to a different system. Therefore, I must\nsuggest that you either:\na. Use an expensive anti-virus system.\nb. Use an expensive computer from a certain \nCupertino-based firm, and still possibly get a virus.\nOR\nc. Use Linux. Like I'm doing right now. It's not rocket \nscience, most of it's not even geeky enough to keep \nmost geeks enthused any more, that's why they invented BSD.\nAnd STILL possibly get a virus. Which was probably patched \nagainst, like, 2 years before you downloaded this folder. \nWhew, close one.\n\nAnd finally, please see  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk/downloads/termsandconditions.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk/downloads/termsandconditions.pdf&lt;/a&gt; \nif you want to buy anything from us. \nWhich you might just if you'd like models like these \nmade to the quality and detail levels we can do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e6f394971e18e40092f172879bbbd659d7db91","amp;dn":"Vulpine+Designs+Unlimited%5C%27s+Release+Into+The+Wild+The+First","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e6f394971e18e40092f172879bbbd659d7db91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,230,243,148,151,30,24,228,0,146,241,114,135,155,187,214,89,215,219,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This was recorded from web tv- so the quality is excellent.\n\nAnd even if Roky's voice start to crack at the end, this show's worth watching. We're talking real legend here. This guy's probably fought more demons than Phil Spector, Brian Wilson and Syd Barret all together..\n\nAnd just for those die hard fans- check out his current girlfriend backstage. Isn't she the very same he was married to in the sixties (if you've seen &quot;You're gonna miss me&quot;, you'll know who I'm refering to..)\n\n\nAnd people..Please help seed. It's kinda hard to upload new stuff regularly when you're stuck as the only seeder every time. Also,- I seed 24-7 as long as it takes.\n\n\nAnyway.. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7b1f52a97dd58f0712a677c3285fd040e469b7f","amp;dn":"Roky+Erickson+Live+Oslo+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7b1f52a97dd58f0712a677c3285fd040e469b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,177,245,42,151,221,88,240,113,42,103,124,50,133,253,4,14,70,155,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But there's more to this 1983 hit than the arrival of a hot young star. Making a stylish debut, writer-director Paul Brickman crafted a subtle satire of crass materialism wrapped in an irresistible plot about a crafty high schooler named Joel (Cruise) who goes into risky business with the beguiling prostitute Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) while his parents are out of town. Joel turns his affluent Chicago-suburb home into a lucrative bordello and forms a steamy personal and professional partnership with Lana, but only as long as the two can avoid the vengeful pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano) and keep their customers happy. A signature film of the 1980s, Risky Business still holds up thanks to Cruise's effortless charm and the movie's timeless appeal as an adolescent male fantasy.\n\nVideo\n\n1280 x 720   1500kbps   24fps   mp4   runtime 1:39:08\n\n\nAudio\n\nMP3 Lame   128kbps   48khz   stereo mixdown dolby pro logic II (5.1)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a300641af2bab97e4e346540f84698e4904f6359","amp;dn":"Risky+Business+1983+720p+1.1+Gb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a300641af2bab97e4e346540f84698e4904f6359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,0,100,26,242,186,185,126,78,52,101,64,248,70,152,228,144,79,99,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

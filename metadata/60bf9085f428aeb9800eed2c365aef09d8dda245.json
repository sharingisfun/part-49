By the mid 1960s he had moved towards jazz, recording with StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Grappelli and Stuff Smith. Ponty&amp;#039;s attraction to jazz was propelled by Miles Davis&amp;#039;s and John Coltrane&amp;#039;s music, which led him to adopt the electric violin. Critic Joachim Berendt wrote that &quot;Since Ponty, the jazz violin has been a different instrument&quot; and of his &quot;style of phrasing that corresponds to early and middle John Coltrane&quot; and his &quot;brilliance and fire&quot;.\n\nIn 1967, he visited the USA for the Monterey Jazz Festival. Ponty subsequently worked with StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Grappelli, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Frank Zappa, and appeared on more than 70 recordings. His symphonic style to jazz fusion made him a popular fusion artist of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1972, he featured prominently on Elton John&amp;#039;s Honky Chateau album.\n\nIn 1977, he pioneered the use of the 5-string electric violin, with a lower C string. He sometimes also uses a 6-string electric violin called the Violectra, with low C and F strings (not to be confused with the violectra he played from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s which had 4 strings, but tuned an octave lower). Ponty was among the firsts to combine the violin with MIDI, distortion boxes, phase shifters, and wah-wah pedals. This resulted in his signature, almost synthesizer-like sound.\n\nIn 2005, Ponty formed the acoustic fusion supergroup Trio! with bassist Stanley Clarke and banjoist BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

This stress is compounded when David's work partner Claire \n(Antonia Campbell-Hughes) gives him a reel of to-be-archived footage \nthat shows that his house was the setting for a brutal murder in \n1902. Becoming progressively more unsettled and unhinged, David \nbegins to believe that a spectral presence is in his house and \nends up following his wife to a nearby canal, where he discovers \nthat she is indeed having an affair with Alex. When Alice goes \nmissing shortly afterwards, David contacts the police- only to \nbecome the prime suspect in her disappearance. As the police grow \nmore convinced that David has murdered his wife, he struggles to \nfind proof of his growing suspicion that something otherworldly \nwas instead responsible. \n \n[color=red]Screenshots[/color]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/8iXdpl5.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/yUhTyQ9.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ZHDbz3y.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DTAR5V3.png[/img]\n\n[color=red][b]Greetz[/b][/color]\n\nTo all ;);)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6b0fc821e94721d6ca2e4d0d11deed4c4fd8d2","amp;dn":"The+Canal+2014+WEBrip+XviD+AC3+MiLLENiUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6b0fc821e94721d6ca2e4d0d11deed4c4fd8d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,107,15,200,33,233,71,33,214,202,46,77,13,17,222,237,76,79,216,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

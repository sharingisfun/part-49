Enterprise returns to spacedock for repairs following the battle with Khan in 2285. Kirk continues to mourn Spock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s death. McCoy suddenly enters the Vulcan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sealed quarters, babbling incoherently. Upon reaching Earth, McCoy is hospitalized. Scotty is reassigned to the U.S.S. Excelsior and the newly formed Genesis Planet is decreed off-limits by Starfleet Command. Kirk is then informed that the U.S.S. Enterprise is to be decommissioned.\n\nIn Kirk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s quarters, Sarek, Spock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s father, confronts the Admiral, saying that Spock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s body should have been returned to Vulcan so that his katra could have been stored in an ancient Vulcan repository on Mount Seleya. Sarek tells Kirk that he must retrieve the coffin from the Genesis planet and, since Spock performed a last-minute Vulcan mind-meld with McCoy, thus transferring his \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;katra\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; or spirit, the doctor must also return to Vulcan.\n\nHowever, Starfleet refuses to allow the antiquated U.S.S. Enterprise to leave spacedock. Released from the hospital and faced with this news, McCoy tries to hire a craft to go back to the Genesis planet. He then starts a brawl and is subsequently arrested, pending further psychiatric examination. The arrest proves futile, though, when McCoy escapes with the help of Kirk, Scott, Sulu, Uhura and Chekov. The crew then beams aboard the deserted U.S.S. Enterprise. To avoid pursuit, Scotty removes an integral engine part from the U.S.S. Excelsior and, knowing that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve all probably destroyed their careers, the six friends take the Enterprise out for one final voyage.\n\nMeanwhile, the Klingons have learned of the new Genesis Device and planet, and fear that it could be a new Federation weapon. Lead by the treacherous Captain Kruge, the Klingons set out to either destroy or capture the valuable device.\n\nOn board the U.S.S. Grissom, David Marcus and Lt. Saavik arrive at the Genesis Planet for scientific observation. They quickly discover a lifeform reading coming from the surface. Intrigued, the two beam to the planet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s surface to find Spock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s empty coffin. Tracing the lifeform reading, the two then find the living body of a child-Spock, aging with erratic rapidity but lacking a consciousness or spirit\n\nDVD9\n\nDirector Leonard Nimoy\n\nActores William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Mark Lenard, Merritt Butrick\n\nDuraciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n 101 min\nRegiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n 2\n\nVideo Pal\nWidescreen , 2.35:1\nIdiomas Audio Dolby Digital 5.1: InglÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s .

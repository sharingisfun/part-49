Repetitive tasks can be accomplished using the built   \n          in scripting language or comprehensive batch conversion    \n                            functionality.                           \n                               3D Path Profile                       \n         Have you ever received a dataset that does not match the    \n        projection of your current project? Simply load the dataset  \n          into Global Mapper, change the projection, and save the    \n          file to match your coordinate system. If the dataset is    \n        larger than the area you are interested in, export the data  \n        using the crop feature and change the projection and format  \n                     of the data at the same time.                   \n                                    Aerial                           \n          Your data files can be loaded as layers, for example a     \n        Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be loaded with a scanned   \n        topographical map to create a 3D view of the map. A digital  \n          aerial image can be draped on the surface together with    \n        vector contour mapping to create a stunning and informative  \n         graphic. The results can be printed, or the workspace can   \n        be exported to a high resolution raster image for use in a   \n                        presentation or report.                      \n                    ***********************************              \n                    ***********************************              \n                      This one is our 1000th Release                 \n         We Thank you all guys ,  Those who love and suport us but   \n                          also those who hate us.                    \n                              Long Live NoPE.       \n\n\n                                1. extract                           \n                               2. install                           \n                    3. run patch into installation dir               \n                                4. have fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba4689c3c8779ff6db495ae4ca47aaeea5b6bea","amp;dn":"Global.Mapper.v10.0.10.0_1000th.Release-NoPE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba4689c3c8779ff6db495ae4ca47aaeea5b6bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,164,104,156,60,135,121,255,109,180,149,174,76,164,122,174,234,91,107,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

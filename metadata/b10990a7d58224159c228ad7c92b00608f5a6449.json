It's not 100% perfect, but the convenience of reading the entire series on a kindle is worth it.\n\nPeople often talk about the kindle's potential as a comic-book reader, with color often mentioned as a drawback. TWD's in glorious black-and-white, and looks great on my device.\n\nThese aren't my scans, kudos to the original scanners - their details remain in the files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10990a7d58224159c228ad7c92b00608f5a6449","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+01-84+for+Kindle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10990a7d58224159c228ad7c92b00608f5a6449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,9,144,167,213,130,36,21,156,34,138,215,201,43,0,96,143,90,100,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It quotes the biblical account of that event (Luke, Chapter 1, verses 26-38) and Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55) with the opening lines:\n\n    The angel Gabriel from heaven came,\n    his wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;\n    &quot;All hail&quot;, said he, &quot;thou lowly maiden Mary,\n    most highly favoured lady.&quot; Gloria.\n\nIt was collected by Charles Bordes and then paraphrased into English by Sabine Baring-Gould, whose use of the lilting phrase Most highly favoured lady made it the favourite carol of Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford. It was performed on the album A Very Special Christmas by Sting, and most recently on the album Christmas Songs by Jars of Clay.\n\nA Very Special Christmas is the first in a series of Christmas-themed compilation albums produced to benefit Special Olympics. The album was released in 1987, and production was overseen by Jimmy Iovine for A&amp;M Records. The cover artwork was designed by Keith Haring.\n\nSting (born as Gordon Matthew Sumner), CBE (born 2 October 1951) is a musician, activist, actor and philanthropist.\n\nPrior to starting his solo career, he was the principal songwriter, lead singer and bassist of the rock music band The Police. As a solo musician and member of The Police, Sting has received sixteen Grammy Awards for his work, receiving his first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1981, and receiving an Oscar nomination for best song. Sting was an influential songwiter during the 1980s. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c86a45a8ad5319c1a3b3212d75b11995fa0dd0","amp;dn":"Sting+-+Gabriel%5C%27s+Message++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c86a45a8ad5319c1a3b3212d75b11995fa0dd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,200,106,69,168,173,83,25,193,163,179,33,45,117,177,25,149,250,13,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Characters include rambling weatherman David Sunshine, and a clueless bank manager.\n\nSeries 1 was known as Nick Mohammed In Quarters. The programme has been re-named as Nick Mohammed In Bits for Series \n\n2...\n\nThe latest series will see Nick return to Radio 4 with his quirky character comedy featuring familiar faces from the \n\nfirst series and entirely new creations. Each half-hour episode focuses on a different character - from Mr Swallow, \n\nthe anger management guru, to a relationship counsellor on the edge.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \nThis sketch show made a great debut we thought. Mohammed impressed us with his performance and his sharp character-\n\nled material. Each episode introduced new characters too - keeping things fresh and original.\n\nIt certainly deserved to get a second series, so we are pleased to hear Nick will be back in a few months for a new \n\nseries, plus the new episodes will now be 30 minutes in length, rather than 15.\n\nCast:\nNick Mohammed\nAnna Crilly\nColin Hoult\n\n\n\nNick Mohammed In Quarters - S01 - E01 \nNick Mohammed In Quarters - S01 - E02 \nNick Mohammed In Quarters - S01 - E03 \nNick Mohammed In Quarters - S01 - E04 \n\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 14mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[b]A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e4191fe007dc53fefaee03ac192252fe6bbca51","amp;dn":"Nick+Mohammed+In+Quaters+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e4191fe007dc53fefaee03ac192252fe6bbca51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,65,145,254,0,125,197,63,239,174,224,58,193,146,37,47,230,187,202,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After Sarah--the girlfriend (Tara Subkoff) of tribal, cave-dwelling teen David (Andrew Keegan)--is sexually assaulted by a shaman, David and his teen friends run away from the tribe and seek refuge in the compound of Neil and Judith--attractive twenty-somethings who introduce the kids to drugs, alcohol, and sex. Unfortunately, the kids don't know that Neil and Judith are indestructible mutants who hold a dangerous secret. TEENAGE CAVEMAN first appeared on Cinemax as part of the CREATURE FEATURES series, which remakes several 1950s monster films from Samuel L. Arkoff's American International Pictures. Director Larry Clark (KIDS, BULLY), imbues the film with an abundance of his trademark sex and violence.-from movies.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ccad26082c00ac1c67947595c88ec83315d778b","amp;dn":"Teenage.Caveman%282001%29DVDRip%28Larry+Clark%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ccad26082c00ac1c67947595c88ec83315d778b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,202,210,96,130,192,10,193,198,121,71,89,92,136,236,131,49,93,119,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

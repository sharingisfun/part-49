Malmsteen became notable in the mid-1980s for his technical fluency and neo-classical metal compositions. Four of his albums, from 1984 to 1988, Rising Force, Marching Out, Trilogy, and Odyssey, ranked in the top 100 for sales.\n\nRising Force won the Guitar Player Magazine&amp;#039;s award for Best Rock Album and was also nominated for a Grammy for &amp;#039;Best Rock Instrumental&amp;#039;, achieving #60 on the Billboard album chart. Yngwie J. Malmsteen&amp;#039;s Rising Force (as his band was thereafter known) next released Marching Out (1985).

Features former Saw Docs bassist Pearse Doherty on four tunes (playing the whistle and singing), and Davy's son on &quot;Hay Wrap&quot;. Also includes two songs recorded, but not yet released, &quot;Friday Town&quot; and &quot;Someone Loves You&quot;.\n\nThe thump in the left channel during &quot;That's What She Said Last Night&quot; is due to the drunken woman behind me trying to get me to dance. You can probably also hear her tunelessly wailing along during &quot;Tommy K&quot;.\n\nThe opening set by Bearfoot was also recorded, and will be posted soon.\n\n\nThe Saw Doctors\nNokia Theatre Times Square\nNew York, NY\nMarch 13, 2009\n\nSource: SP-CMC-19 &gt; SP-SPSB-1 &gt; Edirol R-09\n\nEditing and Conversion: Audacity 1.3.5d (Editing and track splitting) &gt; Trader's Little Helper 2.4.1 (FLAC conversion and fingerprint creation)\n\n1.

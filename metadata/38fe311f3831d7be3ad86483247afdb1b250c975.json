I&amp;#039;ve thoroughly enjoyed it over the years, and thought I&amp;#039;d share it with you. It&amp;#039;s not perfect, but it&amp;#039;s the only KLAS photoscenery I&amp;#039;ve ever seen.\n\nI use it in conjunction with some photoscenery extentions i&amp;#039;ve been developing, which cover areas south, from Boulder City to Jean, Sandy Valley to the southwest, &amp; the Spring Mountains to the west, including Mt. Charleston. I hope to release these soon, as they really add an amazing level of realism to the area, but for now you&amp;#039;ve got some photoreal Las Vegas airspace to fly around in. :-)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38fe311f3831d7be3ad86483247afdb1b250c975","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+FSfreeware+Las+Vegas+Photorealistic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38fe311f3831d7be3ad86483247afdb1b250c975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,254,49,31,56,49,215,190,58,216,100,131,36,122,253,177,178,80,201,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

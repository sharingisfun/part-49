This new aircraft was to be called the F6F Hellcat. The prototype, XF6F-1, first \nflew on June 26, 1942. The first production model was the F6F-3 which first flew in October 1942. Grumman then \nproduced an improved Hellcat designated the F6F-5. This Hellcat first flew on April 4, 1944. This new model \nquickly replaced the F6F-3 models. Production lasted until November 1945, when the F8F replaced the F6F. \nHellcats are credited with the destruction of 4,947 aircraft up to V-J Day. The Hellcat was the first aircraft \nthe Navy had for its Blue Angels demonstration team.\n\n\n\nVideo Codec Code ...: DIVX\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1214 KB/s\nResolution .........: 704 x 480\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.46:1\nFramerate ..........: 29,970 FPS\n\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d15b0b838738ae35d1855391448d503fad96001a","amp;dn":"Aviation%3A+F6F+Hellcat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d15b0b838738ae35d1855391448d503fad96001a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,91,11,131,135,56,174,53,209,133,83,145,68,141,80,63,173,150,0,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

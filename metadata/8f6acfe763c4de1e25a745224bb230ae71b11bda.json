Hanna has released three albums, the debut Old Love, New Love together with the Bjorn Jansson Quartet was released in 2007 and received excellent reviews. The second CD Ferry Yard Road was co-written with Bjorn Jansson. In the fall of 2010 she released her third album Spring, and upcoming in 2011 is a Japanese release, Dream a Little Dream of Me.\n\nTo find your own voice and stile seems to be just as tricky as digging diamonds from your bellybutton. But Hanna Elmquist has succeeded. The voice, the lyrics and the music together make her stand out among jazzsingers.

More popular than any blues album in nearly twenty years, Texas Flood was a surprise success for Vaughan, who had labored in obscurity for years. The album was recorded in only three days, at Jackson Browne's personal recording studio, in 1982 since the band had been playing many live sets beforehand.\n\nOn the North American Billboard Music Charts, Texas Flood peaked at #64 and #38 on the Billboard 200 and Pop Albums charts, respectively. The single &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; peaked at #20 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album was Grammy nominated in 1983 for &quot;Best Blues Recording&quot; along with &quot;Rude Mood&quot;, which was nominated for &quot;Best Blues Instrumental Performance.&quot;\n\nThis album has been released as downloadable content on March 3rd, 2009 for the music video game series Rock Band. It was also featured on the music video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76950f067681aa480b7d2a6d20f435da00df393e","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+-+Love+Struck+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76950f067681aa480b7d2a6d20f435da00df393e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,149,15,6,118,129,170,72,11,125,42,109,32,244,53,218,0,223,57,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

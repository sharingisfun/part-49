According to The New York Times, the UAE secretly signed a $529 million contract with PrinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new company, Reflex Responses, to put together an 800-member battalion of foreign mercenaries. The troops could be deployed if foreign guest workers stage revolts in labor camps, or if the UAE regime were challenged by pro-democracy protests like those sweeping the Arab world. Prince has one rule about the new force: no Muslims.

The audits conclude the banks cheated the government by overvaluing their losses on foreclosed homes and submitting faulty and defective documents to get federal reimbursement. According to the audit, the banks'Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial'violated the False Claims Act, which protects the government from fraudulent billing. The findings have been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5266ede848771a4d88cb0505553ae8c4c793aeda","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+18+may+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5266ede848771a4d88cb0505553ae8c4c793aeda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,102,237,232,72,119,26,77,136,203,5,5,85,58,232,196,199,147,174,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

However in this case you *MUST* let     \n    it connect to the Internet where it will send both name and reg      \n    code to server for blacklist check. This check is only done once     \n    and the details will be accepted if reg code hasn't been             \n    blacklisted.                                                         \n                                                                         \n    The second (and recommended) method is for those that don't want     \n    their name and reg code send to a remote server.  Before doing       \n    these steps you *MUST* run the game at least once and also make      \n    sure the game isn't running.  The easy automated method is just to   \n    hit the &quot;Save Reg&quot; button inside keygen to store details.  To        \n    manually add name and reg code find the plist listed below and       \n    edit &quot;RegName&quot; and &quot;RegCode&quot; respectively.                           \n                                                                         \n    &quot;~/Library/Preferences/com.mcsebi.bubx.plist&quot;                        \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!

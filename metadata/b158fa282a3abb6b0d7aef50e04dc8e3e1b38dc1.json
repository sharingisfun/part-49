Obama is now on the defensive as the vast majority of Americans no longer trust him. \n\nDan Bongino, a former member of the Secret Service's Presidential Protection Division, joins the show to talk about how Obamacare replaced his family's health coverage with more expensive yet lesser quality options. \n\nThe August Forecast &amp; Review Editor Patrick M. Wood also joins the show to discuss how the global elite within the Trilateral Commission are replacing capitalism with their own technocracy in order to create a New International Economic Order. Everything that we have reported on, from Obamacare to mass surveillance, ties back into their objective for a total awareness society.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.

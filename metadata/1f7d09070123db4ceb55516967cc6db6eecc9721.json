So far the single has been released in The United States and New Zealand.\n\nThe music video for this song was released for viewers in the United States on November 9, 2009 on MTV. It features Gabe Saporta driving a walk-in van (with flashing lights, girls, and people in sanitation clothing in the back) through New York City, working for an organization called the Cobra Crew. This organization takes people into the van, evidently to party. Saporta is then kicked out of the driver's seat and a girl starts driving the van, out-of-control at this point. The action transfers to a club, where most of the people fron the van continue the party. The video ends with Saporta lying unconscious on the floor of the van, &quot;Hot Mess&quot; scrawled on his chest in red makeup.\n\n&quot;Hot Mess&quot; debuted at #64 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has since re-entered the chart at #88 on the week ending January 9, 2010.\n\nHot Mess is the third studio album by American pop punk band Cobra Starship, released through Fueled by Ramen and Decaydance Records on August 11, 2009.

These are original recordings which never made it onto our albums in the format they appear here. Rough and ready, but indicative of the bands influences &amp; origins, many of these demos were re-worked into songs which finally appeared on our commercial releases. Ian, an ex-pat Aussie in Brasil came to Newcastle and took a big box of old Spy cassettes back with him to explore and find the best versions of the bands demos. Eternal thanks to Ian for his perseverance &amp; dedication to vSpy vSpy.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7376cd85bceb5a5f4cacdfa77d601e1b39d6fc8a","amp;dn":"vSpy+vSpy+Demolition+2+-+Rough+Heads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7376cd85bceb5a5f4cacdfa77d601e1b39d6fc8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,118,205,133,188,235,90,95,76,172,223,167,125,96,30,27,57,214,252,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

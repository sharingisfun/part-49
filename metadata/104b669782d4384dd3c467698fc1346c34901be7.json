The BitTorrent protocol is a new way of exchanging or distributing data over the internet. Downloading also means uploading, and the amounts of each are linked, to ensure fairness and rapidity in the spread of the file at hand. \n\nFor information on how to set up Azureus, see the Initial_Setup_Guide \n\nTo be able to download a file, you first need to get the associated .torrent file. This file, usually a dozen KB in size, is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsignatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the much bigger file to be downloaded, and it needs special software to be read properly. Azureus is one of those types of software. \n\nIf you want to host files yourself, you need a tracker, which is basically a central server coordinating the connections between peers. Azureus can provide a tracker too. \n\nYou will find, as you discover its functionality, that it is easy to customize your copy of Azureus to exactly fit your needs.\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n\nNew Features:\n\nUI | Config option for max stalled seeding torrents (was hardcoded in 4100) \n\n\n\nChanges:\n\nCore | Remove various debug-spew\n\n\n\nCorrected bugs:\n\nCore | Fix null-pointer-exception when initiasing old categorised shares \n\nCore | Remove accidental invocation of the get-networks Vuze RPC when running in classic UI\n\nCore | Remove null-pointer-exception in TCP connection manager\n\nCore | Fix subscription auto-download with sites where supplied referer caused error\n\n\nUIvz | Click area for Friend's &quot;chat thought bubble&quot; was wrong, preventing click to chat in some cases\n\nUIvz | Fix share of vuze content (users could only share non-vuze content)\n\n\nUI | Column Setup visual fixes for gtk\n\nUI | Revert category buttons to working state\n\nUI | Fixed memory leak in All-Peers view\n\nUI | Fixed resource disposal in config view causing some status bar icons to not draw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104b669782d4384dd3c467698fc1346c34901be7","amp;dn":"Vuze+4.1.0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104b669782d4384dd3c467698fc1346c34901be7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,75,102,151,130,212,56,77,211,196,103,105,143,193,52,108,52,144,27,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

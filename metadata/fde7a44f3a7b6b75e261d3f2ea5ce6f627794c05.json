Don&amp;#039;t be fooled by the glammy looking promo pics of the band, this is one of those glorious albums in the vein of T.K.O.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;In Your Face&quot;, where the glam is in the photoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not in the grooves.\nThe original vinyl is very hard to find nowadays, and such is the records enduring appeal that it was re-released on CD by Retrospect Records in 2004 with slightly altered cover artwork.\nNot to be confused with the NWOBHM band, the New York Heavy Metal act, the 2 Punk outfits, (one English, one German), the Polish Black Metal group, or the Australian Thrash band who all also bore the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; name.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde7a44f3a7b6b75e261d3f2ea5ce6f627794c05","amp;dn":"BLITZKRIEG+%28USA%29+-+Ready+For+Action+Mini+LP+%281985%29+-+80s+Geophag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde7a44f3a7b6b75e261d3f2ea5ce6f627794c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,231,164,79,58,123,107,117,226,97,211,242,234,92,230,246,39,121,76,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Although I don&amp;#039;t believe that there is an Oscar potential for this, I do believe Golden Globe awards for this. Christina Ricci&amp;#039;s performance in this was delightful. While I was watching the movie, however, when Reese Witherspoon popped up, I was delighted! Although it wasn&amp;#039;t very long, it was pleasing to see her in a very different role from others that she took.\n\nHonestly, I just wanted to comment on this and Reese&amp;#039;s funny lines. But the movie should be watched; it&amp;#039;s a comedy that can change the world&amp;#039;s opinions of what&amp;#039;s really beautiful, and that the outside does not matter.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nLGLuX\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7066c5ab6dcd875f123f8828cbbd829676a4c27f","amp;dn":"Penelope.DVDRIP.ENG-LGLuX%28canuslounge%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7066c5ab6dcd875f123f8828cbbd829676a4c27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,102,197,171,109,205,135,95,18,63,136,40,203,189,130,150,118,164,194,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

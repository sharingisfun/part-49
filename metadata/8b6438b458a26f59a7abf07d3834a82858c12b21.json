Released in the United States on November 1, 1994 by Columbia Records, it is a holiday album featuring both cover versions and original material.\n\nIt was released at what was the peak of the initial stretch of Carey&amp;#039;s career, between Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), her two best-selling albums to date. It subsequently went on to become one of the best-selling Christmas albums of all time. As of 2005 it had been certified five times platinum by the RIAA for shipments of five million copies in the U.S.\n\nSeveral singles were released from the album, but most were on a strictly promotional basis in the U.S. to help boost sales of the album. The first, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, was a radio airplay hit in the U.S. and sold well in countries where it was given a commercial release. The second, &quot;Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)&quot; (whose video was directed by Diane Martel) was less popular on U.S. radio, as was &quot;Joy to the World&quot; (which had been considered for a full single release), though the latter was a top forty hit in Australia and on the U.S. dance/club play charts.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6438b458a26f59a7abf07d3834a82858c12b21","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Miss+You+Most+%28At+Christmas+Time%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6438b458a26f59a7abf07d3834a82858c12b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,100,56,180,88,162,111,89,167,171,240,125,56,52,168,40,88,193,43,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

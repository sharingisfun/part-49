Roy and Helen are the &quot;Odd Couple&quot; of the 1990s; Roy watches too much TV every night and Helen just cannot stand it. In layman's terms, they have marriage problems of their own. Then one night later would be the night that would change their lives forever; Helen offers Roy on a romantic getaway without phones, their children, and especially no TV. Unfortunately, when Roy's hooked hooked on the big screen, there's no going back. This frustrates and angers her and decides to smash the family console with one of Roy's trophies as a wake-up call to reality. A heartbroken-to-disoriented Roy then hears the doorbell and finds out that it's a mysterious salesman named Spike who offers him the &quot;ultimate getaway&quot; from all the hate, frustration, and failures: a new remote controller and a new state-of-the-art satellite TV. Roy accepts the new TV by signing a free trial contract not knowing that he just sold his soul to the devil himself. But later, Helen is both not impressed and steamed. After a fight outside, the &quot;dish&quot; activates. Roy and Helen try as hard as possible to escape, but it was too late for the force of gravity from the dish sucks them into the &quot;Cable Television World of Hell&quot;- all six hundred and sixty-six channels worth. Now they must survive through every episode of shows such as the game show &quot;You Can't Win&quot;, the U.W.W.F. (Underworld Wrestling Federation) match, &quot;Northern Overexposure&quot;, &quot;RoboCat&quot;, a cartoon, and &quot;Off With His Head&quot;, all within 24 hours. If successful, they will return back to home, but if they fail, the devil keeps their souls forever. After they survived one day without harm, only Roy gets sent back home while Spike hold Helen hostage. Now with the help of their children, Daryl, a communication whiz and Diane, a fashion freak, Roy must go back to the underworld and save his wife while keeping a distance from Spike. It is then that Roy will learn the hard way that there's more things in life than only a television\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDirector: Peter Hyams\n\n\nCast:\n\nJohn Ritter ...

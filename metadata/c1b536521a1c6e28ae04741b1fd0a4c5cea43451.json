But its a GOOD version, non-promo, and non-radio-edit version. only 128kbs but its the best i could find. and since TPB didn&amp;#039;t have one (aside from the promo) i thought i&amp;#039;d add it here. although i had to make my own torrent (the isohunt version didn&amp;#039;t have any TPB trackers)\n\nand before you bitch or complain about the 128kbs, re-read the part where i said its not my torrent :-p   furthermore 128kbs is good enough and a HELL of alot smaller ;) and besides i doubt many of you, that just HAVE to have the +384 versions and stuff, are probly playing them on cheap ass speakers/headphones anyway. so not like you could hear a difference :-p\n\n\n-- Rellik\nEnjoy, and Please Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b536521a1c6e28ae04741b1fd0a4c5cea43451","amp;dn":"Seether+-+Fake+It+%5BRPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b536521a1c6e28ae04741b1fd0a4c5cea43451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,181,54,82,26,28,110,40,174,4,116,27,31,208,164,197,206,164,52,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Telling rejoinder.\nOn standardly adjusted system, GP disables near 50 - 70 programs and services! \nBesides, it is possible to start the game with the increased priority.\nAll this allows to use the computer practically on a maximum for high-end PC games.\nIt is clear that disabling everything, - there would be no neither network, nor Internet. \nTherefore  who plays network games GP does not approach. Though in most cases it also is not necessary. \nIn the next versions it will be possible to play with enabled network.\n\nSo, Game Prelauncher prepares system only for gaming, disabling all unnecessary and focus the system &quot;attention&quot; only on the game (priority).\n\nInstallation\n===========================\nThe program does not depend on installation.\nJust copy the GP in any place, in the separate folder,\nFor example in &amp;#039; C:\\Program Files\\Game Prelauncher\\&amp;#039; \n\n\n\nUsing Game Prelauncher\n===========================\nGP is only for Windows XP!\nOther operation systems are not supported at the moment.\n\nGame Preluncher has easy-to-use interface and the wizard for fast profile adjustment, \nhowever, if you are not sure, here the detailed description.\n\nSo, beginning from button &quot;Wizard&quot;. \n\n\n\n\no Game Prelauncher Wizard.\n\n  Step 1. Programs paths \n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nClick button &quot; Browse &quot; and add programs you want to run after Windows would be loaded. \nSet starting order (mouse dragging), game should be at the end of the list.\n\nAlso you can  set CPU priority for each, but it is not necessary.\nTo delete item - select it and press &amp;#039;Del&amp;#039;.\n\nMaybe you need to start 5.1 sound driver or need to insert ISO so add this apps to list. \nIf you don&amp;#039;t know what must be started just add the path of the game.\n\nE.g: Winamp (playlist) - normal priority, Doom3 - normal priority.\n\nIf you need some autorun programs click &quot;Show Startup App[lications]&quot; button.\n\n\n  Step 2. Unloading Explorer from memory.\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n Explorer really takes some CPU resources (especially under XP without any installed service packs) and  memory. \n But some games like Silent Hill 3 cannot start without running Explorer cause of using Explorer&amp;#039;s    multimedia features.\n In this case - uncheck it.\n Most games can start without running Explorer.\n  \n  * If this checkbox was checked and the game do not start try following:  \n   In profile disable the option of Explorer terminating \n   (In the main window of the program click &quot;Edit&quot; button, uncheck &quot;Terminate Explorer&quot; checkbox), \n  \n   Then start Explorer manually \n   (button Options in the main window &gt;&gt; item menu &quot;Run&quot; and type &quot;Explorer&quot;)\n\n\n Step 3. Profile Name \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSpecify the profile filename.\n\nProfile with the same name will be overwritten. \n\n Step 4 and 5.\n ~~~~~~~~~~\n Reports.\n\n\nFast start\n===========================\nSo, for example,you want to start Half-Life 2 or Doom 3.\n\n1. Button &quot; Wizard &quot; &gt; &gt; to specify a way of the game (&quot;C:\\Doom3\\Doom3.exe&quot;, set high priority.\n2. Check &quot;Terminate Explorer&quot;, to unload it.\n3. Name - &quot;Doom 3&quot;,  &quot; Run profile &quot; - checked status), and press button &quot; Restart &quot;.\n\nAfter Windows would be restarted game will be started automatically.\n\nAfter you exit from the game press Restore and then restart.\n\n\nContacts\n~~~~~~~~~\nFor software updates please visit :\n  GamePrelauncher.ho.com.ua \n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe program is very small (e.g version 1.00 - 72.4 kilobytes)\n\nFeel free to contact me.

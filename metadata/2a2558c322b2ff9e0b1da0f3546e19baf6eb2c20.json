I did not see this on tpb, but quite frankly I did not look that hard.\n\nMick Jagger - Out Of Focus (CD single from the album &quot;Wandering Spirit&quot; from 1993)\n\nit contains:\n\n1. Out Of Focus (7&quot; Hipgrass)\n2. Out Of Focus (Album Version)\n3. Out Of Focus (12&quot; Hipgrass)\n4. Out Of Focus (12&quot; Whatstax Dub)\n\nNote that if you ever seen the music video for Out Of Focus, it is actually the 7&quot; Hipgrass version and not the album version (easy to tell the difference). If you've ever been wanting &quot;that video version&quot; (for some reason or another) you are in luck - because here it is. Freshly ripped in 192kbps LAME, joint stereo.\n\nI'll probably find both my &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; singles soon as well. Completists rejoice.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2558c322b2ff9e0b1da0f3546e19baf6eb2c20","amp;dn":"Mick+Jagger+-+Out+Of+Focus+%28cd+single%29+192kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2558c322b2ff9e0b1da0f3546e19baf6eb2c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,37,88,195,34,178,255,158,11,29,160,243,84,110,25,186,246,235,44,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

On the harsh plains of the         \n    Tibetan plateau live extraordinary bears and             \n    square-faced foxes hunting small rodents to survive. In   \n    the alpine forests, dancing pheasants have even            \n    influenced rival border guards in their ritualistic       \n    displays.

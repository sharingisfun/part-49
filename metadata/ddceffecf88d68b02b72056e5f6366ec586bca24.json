With Tim Kasher on guitar/vocals; Matt Maginn on bass; Stephen Pederson on guitar, and Clint Schnase drumming, the Omaha-based band divides its songs into two acts: man vs. nature, and man vs. himself, straying from one-shot efforts on Such Blinding Stars for Starving Eyes and establishing a loosely based concept album. A lot of the songs on this release seem to harp on the idea of being frustrated with incomplete thoughts and, like many so-called emo bands, the inability to put together the right string of words to accurately describe a feeling. See ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Rhyme SchemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Semantics of Sermon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Though his voice is unbearably whiny at times, KasherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics are right on target and clever, showing hints of self-deprecating humor and offering apologies for the limitations of their chosen art form ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the math rock/pop song structure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which becomes more pronounced in CursiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later releases. While Cursive incorporate many of the same devices that bands like Fugazi, Chavez, and Burning Airlines have used, The Storms of Early Summer is ultimately a great melodic rock album with angular rhythms and explosive guitar work that tells a story of confronting frustration and loss and asking what it takes to keep forging through oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daily existence.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1998\nLabel: Saddle Creek Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1.

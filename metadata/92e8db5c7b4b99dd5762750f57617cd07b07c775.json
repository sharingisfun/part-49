Now Melodic/AOR fans have a reason to celebrate with the release of SunstormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of DreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The return of the Joe Lynn Turner fronted project should be celebrated by not only melodic/aor fans but any fans of music that love well written songs loaded with plenty of melody and hooks galore. A virtual whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s who of songwriters, producers, and musicians lent their talents to this project lead by Dennis Ward (Pink Crean 69) who not only returned to the helm as producer but also supplied all the bass and background vocals on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of DreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Jim Peterik (Survivor, Pride of Lions), Tom and James Martin (House of Lords, Khymera) returned and Paul Sabu also came on board to help out in the songwriting process. Besides the presence of Turner and Ward this time around the band consists of Uwe Reitenauer and Thorsten Koehne on guitars, Chris Schmidt on drums and Gunter Werno on keyboards, all of which are accomplished musicians in their own right.\n\nFrom the opening keyboards of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Found LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I knew I was in for one hell of an enjoyable ride and I was not disappointed at all. Great keyboards, and guitar with a chorus that will have you singing along long after the song is finished playing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDividedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ follows the same formula with the same excellent results. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Give UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ makes me think back to the 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and those movie montage theme songs where the hero is trying to over come the impossible, much like SurvivorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEye of the TigerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurning HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or Robert TepperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo Way OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Along with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Found LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGutters of GoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is my favorite song on the album with SchmidtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard driving drums and an awesome chorus. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is another stand out track that was written by Desmond Child and Joe Lynn Turner that originally appeared on Jimmy BarneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1987 release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFreight Train HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe one thing you will not find on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of DreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is filler material, every song has hit potential if they are given a chance. Although there is no mistaking that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of DreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a melodic rock album with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soaring vocals, guitar solos and keyboards the music is modern sounding and does not sound dated whatsoever.\n\nIf I have one complaint about Sunstorm it is the fact that in all actuality this is a side project. With the way the music scene is today a band this great with an album this great itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame it canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be the primary focus of the players involved.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.

Goodman was diagnosed with leukemia while attending college, and he set out to make the most of the time he had left to write music. A prolific writer, Goodman is best known for penning &quot;City of New Orleans,&quot; a song made popular by Arlo Guthrie and Willie Nelson, for which Goodman won his first Grammy Award posthumously in 1985, with a second Grammy awarded to him in 1988 for Unfinished Business. Today, the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team plays &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; at the conclusion of each home game, a song Goodman wrote for his beloved team. Steven Goodman is survived by his wife and three daughters.\n\nGoodman's songs first appeared on Gathering at The Earl of Old Town, an album produced by Chicago record company Dunwich in 1971. As a close friend of Earl Pionke, the owner of the folk music bar, Goodman performed at The Earl dozens of times, including customary New Year's Eve concerts. He also remained closely involved with Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music, where he had met and mentored his good friend, John Prine.\nLater in 1971, Goodman was playing at a Chicago bar called the Quiet Knight as the opening act for Kris Kristofferson. Kristofferson, impressed with Goodman, introduced him to Paul Anka, who brought Goodman to New York to record some demos. These resulted in Goodman signing a contract with Buddah Records.\nAll this time, Goodman had been busy writing many of his most enduring songs, and this avid songwriting would lead to an important break for him. While at the Quiet Knight, Goodman saw Arlo Guthrie, and asked to be allowed to play a song for him. Guthrie grudgingly agreed, on the condition that Goodman buy him a beer first; Guthrie would listen to Goodman for as long as it took Guthrie to drink the beer. Goodman played &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; (original lyrics), which Guthrie liked enough that he asked to record it. Barry McGuire, however, has told concert-goers recently that he was present at that meeting and it occurred at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, according to San Diego Arlophile Rodger Hartnett.[citation needed]\nGuthrie's version of Goodman's song became a Top-20 hit in 1972, and provided Goodman with enough financial and artistic success to make his music a full-time career. The song, about the Illinois Central's City of New Orleans train, would become an American standard, covered by such musicians as Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, Chet Atkins and Willie Nelson, whose recorded version earned Goodman a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1985. A French translation of the song, &quot;Salut Les Amoureux&quot;, was recorded by Joe Dassin in 1973. A Dutch singer, Gerard Cox, heard the French version while on holiday and translated it into Dutch, titled &quot;'t Is Weer Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer&quot; (&quot;The summer has come to an end&quot;). It reached number one on the Dutch Top 40 in December 1973 and has become a classic which is still played on Dutch radio.[citation needed] Lyrically, the French and Dutch versions bear no resemblance to Goodman's original lyrics. According to Goodman, the song was inspired by a train trip he and his wife took from Chicago to Mattoon, Illinois.[3] According to the liner notes on the Steve Goodman anthology &quot; No Big Surprise &quot; ... &quot; City of New Orleans &quot; was written while on the campaign trail with Senator Edwin Muskie.\n\nIn 1974, singer David Allan Coe achieved considerable success on the country charts with Goodman's and John Prine's &quot;You Never Even Call Me By My Name&quot;, a song which good-naturedly spoofed stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit of the song, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties.\nGoodman's success as a recording artist was more limited. Although he was known in folk circles as an excellent and influential songwriter,[citation needed] his albums received more critical than commercial success. One of Goodman's biggest hits was a song he didn't write ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ &quot;The Dutchman&quot;, written by Michael Peter Smith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046474159600256074c6209a1497764bd77ae9db","amp;dn":"Steve+Goodman+-+Same+%281971%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046474159600256074c6209a1497764bd77ae9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,100,116,21,150,0,37,96,116,198,32,154,20,151,118,75,215,122,233,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

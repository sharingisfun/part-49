The album includes eleven \ncovers and one original track titled &quot;The Grind&quot;. The sound reflects Aerosmith&amp;#039;s\nblues-based influences and showcases a rawer sound (reminiscent of their 1970s\nheyday) compared to their recent commercial efforts.\n\nReaching # 5 on The Billboard 200, Honkin&amp;#039; on Bobo has sold 590,000 units in the\nU.S. as of October 2006, having been certified gold.\n\nIn keeping with much of the sexual slang and innuendo Steven Tyler incorporates\ninto his lyrics, the idiom &amp;#039;honking on bobo&amp;#039; is slang for felatio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54badcc01446e013c5118c9530002bbbe9adef9a","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+Honkin+on+Hobo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54badcc01446e013c5118c9530002bbbe9adef9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,186,220,192,20,70,224,19,197,17,140,149,48,0,43,187,233,173,239,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

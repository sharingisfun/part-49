S. 1 (Marvel)\n&quot;High Adventure Trucking Down the Highway.&quot;\n12 issues. 1983/84 series.\n\nThis is a Request from the Forums.\n\nCreators\nWriter: Al Milgrom\nArtist: Herb Trimpe, Frank Springer, Steve Ditko\nColorer: Christie Scheele\nLetterer: Michael Higgins\nEditor: Ralph Macchio\n\nSynopsis\nThe comic book featured a truck driver, who had a CB radio in his head and his truck was computerized much like the Knight Rider 2000. The driver was being pursued by the Highwayman.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Written by Affable Al Milgrom with pencils by Herb Trimpe, Frank Springer, and even Swingin' Steve Ditko, U.S. 1 is a masterpiece of the comics form screaming down the highway from 1983. Released just in time to capitalize on the fame generated by Jerry Reed's tour-de-force in Smokey and the Bandit 3, it only lasted twelve issues, despite storylines that featured such diverse themes as trucking, fighting at truck stops, and alien spacecraft powered by uncooked chicken legs.\n\nSeriously, Milgrom passes &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; by page three, and from then on out, the entire series is so ridiculously aware of its own ridiculous premise that there are editor's notes criticizing the puns in the dialogue. It's beautiful.&quot;\n\nExcerpt taken from Chris Invincible's Super-Blog. \n\n\nNote:\nThe content of this torrent was retrieved from the eD2K Network.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8da159d18487bf9303cb3339ab9822c2f68e309","amp;dn":"U.S.+1+%281983%29+-+01+-+12+-+%28CC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8da159d18487bf9303cb3339ab9822c2f68e309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,218,21,157,24,72,123,249,48,60,179,51,154,185,130,44,47,104,227,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

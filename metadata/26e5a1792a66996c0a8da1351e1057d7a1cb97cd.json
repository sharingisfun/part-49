It was released on October 18, 1989. The album cover was inspired by a movie poster for the original Ocean's Eleven.\n\nThe Smithereens are a rock band from Carteret, New Jersey, United States. The group formed in 1980 with members Pat DiNizio (vocals &amp; guitar), Jim Babjak (guitar &amp; vocals), Mike Mesaros (bass guitar &amp; vocals), and Dennis Diken (drums &amp; percussion) . This lineup continued until 2006, when Mesaros left the band and Severo Jornacion took over on bass guitar.\n\nThe Smithereens have collaborated with numerous musicians, both in the studio (Suzanne Vega and Belinda Carlisle) and live (Graham Parker and The Kinks). The band's name comes from a Yosemite Sam catchphrase, &quot;Varmint, I'm a-gonna blow you to smithereens!&quot;\n\nBabjak, Diken, and Mesaros are all from Carteret, New Jersey and graduated from Carteret High School in 1975. In 1980, they formed the band with DiNizio, who is from Scotch Plains, New Jersey.\n\nThe Smithereens are known for writing and playing catchy 1960s-influenced power pop. The group gained publicity when a single from its first album, &quot;Blood and Roses&quot;, was included on the soundtrack for, and as the theme song of the 1986 Albert Pyun movie, Dangerously Close, and the video got some moderately heavy rotation on MTV. &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; was also featured on the 1980s TV show Miami Vice during the episode 'The Savage' (first aired February 6, 1987).\n\nThe group spent some time in its initialphase defending itself in Rolling Stone against thinly-veiled accusations of sounding too much like The Byrds and The Beatles, pointing out that its Marshall Amplifier-heavy live sound was closer to heavy metal than it was to The Beatles. The Smithereens have always worn their inspirations proudly, but the band also influenced other musicians, most notably Kurt Cobain during the period he was writing Nevermind. Ironically, some feel the Smithereens (like many early 1990s bands) were hurt by the rise of grunge.\n\nAlong with a basic Eastern-coast roots-rock sound that owed much to the inspirations of DiNizio, including Buddy Holly, The Who, The Clash, Elvis Costello, and Nick Lowe, the Smithereens deployed a uniquely retro obsession with Mod, the lateInvasion pop of John's Children and The Move, and other artifacts of fifties and sixties culture that lent its music substance. The title and lyrics of their song, &quot;In a Lonely Place,&quot; appear to be based on the 1950 Humphrey Bogart film of the same name, including the lyrics, &quot;I was born the day I met you, lived a while when you loved me, died a little when we broke apart.&quot; The title and artwork for the album 11 were a nod to the original 1960 Ocean's Eleven film.\n\nThe Smithereens starred as themselves and were featured as the entertainment in the indoor beach party scene of the Troma film Class of Nuke 'Em High, playing the song &quot;Much Too Much&quot;.\n\nThe highest position a Smithereens album attained on the Billboard pop charts was in 1990, when 11 peaked at #41 on the strength of the single &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; (which hit #38). &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; was originally written to be the title track for the 1989 Cameron Crowe film Say Anything....\n\nThe group is still active and tours frequently. The basic tracks for their next studio album of original material were recorded in early October 2010 and the album is expected to be released in April 2011.\n[edit] Members\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e5a1792a66996c0a8da1351e1057d7a1cb97cd","amp;dn":"The+Smithereens+-+Blues+Before+And+After+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e5a1792a66996c0a8da1351e1057d7a1cb97cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,229,161,121,42,102,153,108,10,141,161,53,30,16,87,215,161,203,151,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

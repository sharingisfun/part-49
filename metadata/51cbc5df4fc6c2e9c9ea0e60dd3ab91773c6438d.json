Assassination?\n\nA bullet?s bizarre trajectory, a grassy knoll and a suspect shot to death just two days after a president?s assassination ? it?s been more than 40 years since John F. Kennedy was gunned down while driving past Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, and most people are still not sure who was responsible. The majority believes Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone; polls show that as many as 70 per cent feel it was part of a broader plot; while two-thirds think there was a government cover-up. There is no shortage of blame to go around and theories to explore. Was it a shadow government of the rich and right wing that ordered Kennedy killed? Did Cuban exiles ? or even Fidel Castro ? organize the murder? Or was it a plot by a national or international agency like the CIA, FBI or KGB? This episode examines who had the most to gain.

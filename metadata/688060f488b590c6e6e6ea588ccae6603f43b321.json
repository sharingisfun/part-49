The black South Africans were looked down upon and segregated at every turn. Any instance of fighting back was a sign of terrorism and treason. This film, Catch a Fire, is based on the true-life story of Patrick Chamusso whose life was turned upside. A man who was apolitical and loving to his family, Chamusso was unaccounted for during a span of time in which the oil refinery he worked at was bombed. As a top suspect he was arrested and tortured, along with his wife to try and make him comply, before finally being released. Patrick did nothing wrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at least as far as arson goes, the missing time was due to infidelityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and as a result of being accused and beaten decided to do something his people could be proud of and try to stop the persecution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688060f488b590c6e6e6ea588ccae6603f43b321","amp;dn":"Catch+a+Fire%5B2006%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D.ShumbaRules-avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688060f488b590c6e6e6ea588ccae6603f43b321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,128,96,244,136,181,144,198,230,230,234,88,140,202,230,96,63,67,179,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

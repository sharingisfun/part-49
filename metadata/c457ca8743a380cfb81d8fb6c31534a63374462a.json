Probably because metal is too rich to get included in that sort of thing. \nThus I decided to make mine and to offer it to you. Of course, so as to capture the richness and diversity of metal, I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do anything but a TOP 1000. As the definitive files are 8.5 Gb, I decided to cut the torrent into 10 pieces of less than 1 Gb, that I think is easier to download, and this way you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to wait 3 days of dling to get something. \n\nThis series of torrents is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you get me- a declaration of love and 15 years of lovable hearing to it. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ok, if top 101 to 1000 just serve the variety of it, the most important and definitive metal is the top 100, which I will post the last. So I will post the files in the inverse order. As soon as I see the torrent quite seeded (I guess around 10 seeds) I post the next one until the heart and the top of it : the top 100. \nSo, for now, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s useless to get into the type of judgment that follows  : \n1.\tthat track should be in that place and not this one ; \n2.\tthat track of MetallicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better than this one ;  \n3.\tMegadethÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much better than Metallica or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeace sellsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ better than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRust In PeaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n4.\tThe grind genre is not enough represented ;  \n5.\tOr that track is better than the (so-called) single... \nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time for everything. \n\nRemember the principles I had in mind : \n1.\tA track represents an album. Sometimes, I put 2 tracks of an album, if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A killer. \n2.\tSometimes, I just included one track because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s THE track, though I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like the band more than that. Exemple : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJumpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Van Halen. \n3.\tAll my choices are from a musical point of view. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get and see that especially in the top 100. \n4.\tThe Prog genre will be more represented than the rest. For that reason, iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll quite often choose the longest track in an album. For 2 reasons : itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very often the very best (exemple : Redemption or DT), and I get (and you by extension) the maximum of it with a tune that is 15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ minutes long out of a 45ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album (exemple Zero Hour, one of my fave). The biais is for death metal, where the shortest ones are quite often the most brutal. \n5.\tOf course, more than 20 % of it reflet my personal taste. Well, if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like Skyclad, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s useless to say it, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care. \n6.\tSome genres are underrated on this TOP 1000 (if it should represents the global sales of metal throughout the world) : Neo-metal, Power-Heavy and Breast-Metal (sic). Concerning Power-heavy, the reason is musical, since Iron Maiden, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obviously very few ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmusical updatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or innovation. I saw one with the very first Rhapsody album (one remembers when it came out ?), but since, almost nothing, sorry for the fans of Hammerfall (remember the first one which I got in pict LP) or anything else. For Neo-metal (which sold the more in recent years), if I like KoRn some time to time, I get bored with the others very soon (to say the least). And for Breast-Metal, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simple: that TOP 1000 is about music, and not pre-adolescent frustrations and fantasies, although I got Nightwish and Within T. represented. Yet, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m like anybody else, Sharon is so a diva... (wrong on stage, but so beautiful... You see itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no music!). \n7.\tThe point is nonetheless to be representative of the history throughout the years and to get you discover some things, in a range from FM to very brutal (and tech.) death metal. \n8.\tI canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get all the band in my top. I take an exemple, the last The Faceless album. Although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very good, I have to make a choice. Tech. Brutal death is nowadays an (almost) major genre in the undergroundingscene. A great number of band are performing huge quality brutal death. You simply got to make a choice then. So I picked up another one at the time I get it done. So if you got some band in mind (maybe that I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know and, as I listen to every style, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell me who I am if I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know the band of the little brother of Mustis when he was 17, who recorded a muthafucking demo on tape, on which thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that very track in atmo. Black metal that re-defined the genre ? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are you serious ?), keep quiet, and look if that kind of music is not somewhere else in the METAL TOP 1000. \n9.\tSome tracks have nothing to see with metal (jazzy and jazz-rock). Well, they please me, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be happy if you discover them, and are willing to enlarge your musical tastes and experiences. But be confident, almost everything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s say from 1 to 799 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is a killer... And even after nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°1000. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s say from 1001 to 1100 where I can put rarities, forgotten and recent ones. \n\nFinally, most of it all is mp3 from 128 to192. but some time itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wma 128 to 192 (when I made it quicker and picked in my collection). Because I had it done previously, i did not recompress it... But most of it is mp3. I tried to update it with some last issues. By exemple, the last ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrack The SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Mastodon. Certainly a TOP 3 in 2009. Buy it. \n\nI repeat, this torrent is to make you discover some bands, to get you support them by buying what is worth buying. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sure that this selection (TOP 1000) will perfectly fit me, but I think it should fit 80 % of you, if you are neutral or objective. Discussion open for musical debate when the TOP 1-100 will be there. \n\nPS : IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m trying to make it work and seed properly. Patience is a piece of art. \n\nAnd now... Get it loud ! And Seed as long as you can ! \n\nI had a pb with the previous part 901-1000, so here it is once again.

When it does so, however, it does not create on executable file but an &quot;install folder&quot; of sorts.\n\nWhat I have done done is install FDM 2.5 from www.freedownloadmanager.org and all it&amp;#039;s plugins under a clean XP (virtual machine). Then create the portable folder. Then make a single executable of that. All you have to do is double click my file and the folder is extracted to a temp location.\n\nNote FDM portable is able to register itself with the browser on execution and unregisteres when exited. So remember to actually exit the program when done using it.\n\nLet me know if anything goes wrong with this. &amp;#039;m using it right now and it works great!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f7fb03b19c6610d6bab7f93863898f28ccaf3f","amp;dn":"Free+Download+Manager+2.5+Portable+%5BKryptic+Chewie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f7fb03b19c6610d6bab7f93863898f28ccaf3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,247,251,3,177,156,102,16,214,186,183,249,56,99,137,143,40,204,175,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

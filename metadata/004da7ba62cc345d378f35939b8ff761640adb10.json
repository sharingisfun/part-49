But the theft of a priceless deity of Lord Ganesh (the Elephant God) from a local household forces him to start investigation. Feluda comes in direct confrontation with Maganlal Meghraj (Utpal Dutt), a ruthless trader. Maganlal makes the mild-mannered Lalmohan a knife-thrower's target and threatens Felu to stop investigation. But there are several other suspects as an innocent artisan is brutally murdered, a shady 'holy man' holds court on the banks of the Ganges and an adventure-loving little boy (and his grand-father), brought up on crime thrillers. The climax is a shoot-out on the Ganges, followed by the unraveling of the mystery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004da7ba62cc345d378f35939b8ff761640adb10","amp;dn":"Jai+Baba+Felunath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004da7ba62cc345d378f35939b8ff761640adb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,77,167,186,98,204,52,93,55,143,53,147,155,143,247,97,100,10,219,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

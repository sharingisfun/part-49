The chief guard gives each of them a pair of heavy bowling balls, just so they won't get too bored. Three months later, the chief guard comes in inspection and asks the three prisoners how they are doing.\n\nThe American says: &quot;Hey, giving me those bowling balls was a great idea! I had nothing else to do, so I worked out a lot with those balls, and look at me now: I can do a hundred push-ups in no time!&quot;\n\nThe German says: &quot;Sir, thank you for giving me those bowling balls! I had nothing else to do, so I began studying them. I discovered a lot of new theorems in non-euclidean geometry, they're all in this notebook.&quot;\n\nThe Romanian says: &quot;Oh sir, I am really sorry... you know, those balls... it's really not my fault, but one of them broke and the other one is nowhere to be found!&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b2d7fc4c009efeef2d07d567eb7fcd0f17db30","amp;dn":"Plone-2.5-VirtualBox-Virtual_Appliance-Ready_To_Use","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b2d7fc4c009efeef2d07d567eb7fcd0f17db30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,178,215,252,76,0,158,254,239,45,7,213,103,235,127,205,15,23,219,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

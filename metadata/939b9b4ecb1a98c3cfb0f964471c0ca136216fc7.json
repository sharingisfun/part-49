It was released on June 24, 1987, and earned only modest returns, but has gone on to become a seminal cult classic on video.\nIts plot and characters contain numerous parodies of elements primarily from the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as Star Trek and other popular science fiction films. The script was written by Mel Brooks in only six months, and was approved by George Lucas, as he was a big fan of Brooks' previous films.[1] Special effects were done by Apogee, Inc.\nVideo\nSize 685mb  avi\n\nLength:  01:36:10\n\nFrame Height  608\n\nFrame Width   326\n\nBitrate  900kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:939b9b4ecb1a98c3cfb0f964471c0ca136216fc7","amp;dn":"SPACEBALLS_LB.Title1.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"939b9b4ecb1a98c3cfb0f964471c0ca136216fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,155,155,78,203,26,152,195,207,176,249,100,71,28,12,161,54,33,111,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Lodge leader Red Green (Steve Smith) considers various money-making schemes the men dream up, like selling road kill on the Internet. But it's Harold, Red's nerdy nephew, who comes up with an idea that just might save their wood-smoked bacon: a duct tape sculpture contest in Minneapolis with a $10,000 third-place prize. Before you can say &quot;go for the bronze,&quot; Red and Harold are hitching the Possum van to their can't-fail, low-ball entry and heading for trouble. \n\nWill Harold get the credit he craves and the girl he deserves (or vice versa)? Is their goose cooked or will it fly?\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e5c5d8c3d2661900c8e863d09deb59394f60e4","amp;dn":"Duct+Tape+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e5c5d8c3d2661900c8e863d09deb59394f60e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,229,197,216,195,210,102,25,0,200,232,99,208,157,235,89,57,79,96,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

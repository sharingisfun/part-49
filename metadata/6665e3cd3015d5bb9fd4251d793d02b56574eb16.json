What's as surprising as the song choices is that Kaplansky makes so much of the material sound so much the same, as if she isn't as emotionally invested in it as she is in her own writing. An exception is her duet with Buddy Miller on &quot;Somewhere Trouble Don't Go,&quot; written by Buddy's wife, Julie. Kaplansky receives stellar support from Larry Campbell (formerly with Bob Dylan) on slide and steel guitars, and harmonies from Jonatha Brooke, Eliza Gilkyson, and Richard Shindell. Yet &quot;Today's the Day,&quot; a song about the death of Kaplansky's father, with minimal musical backing, is the most compelling performance here.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/02/lucy-kaplansky/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6665e3cd3015d5bb9fd4251d793d02b56574eb16","amp;dn":"Lucy+Kaplansky...Over+the+Hills%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6665e3cd3015d5bb9fd4251d793d02b56574eb16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,101,227,205,48,21,213,187,159,212,37,29,121,61,2,181,101,116,235,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

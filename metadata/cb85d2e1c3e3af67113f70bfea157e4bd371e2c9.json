From east to west, via mountains, volcanoes, deserts, lakes and Arctic ice, this breathtaking six-part series uses stunning cinematography to chart the dazzling natural wonders of this vast country.\n\nSIBERIA \nAccounting for around 10 per cent of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dry land, Siberia is famous as a brutally cold place. Yet it is home to a diverse range of habitats and animal life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including musk deer, camels, gazelles and the extraordinary Siberian salamander, which can spend years encased in -40Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C ice and still survive. Exploring from the frozen north to the southern steppes, this is the real Siberia.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 464 MiB for 47mn 6s 360ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Science/Nature\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 234 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 368 (1.696) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb85d2e1c3e3af67113f70bfea157e4bd371e2c9","amp;dn":"NGC-Wild+Russia+2of6.SIBERIA+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb85d2e1c3e3af67113f70bfea157e4bd371e2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,133,210,225,195,227,175,103,17,63,112,191,234,21,126,75,211,113,226,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

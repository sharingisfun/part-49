The Move's version was released as a single, their first release on the Harvest label, and charted at number eleven on the UK single charts. Jeff Lynne, who had joined the group the previous year, takes lead vocal on the second verse.\n\n             Redbone is a Native American rock group that was most active in the 1970s. They reached the Top 5 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1974 with the million-selling Gold-certified single, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot;.\n            Redbone played primarily rock music with R&amp;B, Cajun, Jazz, tribal, and Latin roots. Their first commercial success came with the single &quot;Maggie&quot; from their second album, Potlatch, in 1970, and two other hit singles followed - &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; (1971, #21 on the Billboard Hot 100) and &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; (1974, #5 on the Billboard Hot 100). &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot;, written by Lolly Vasquez stayed in the Billboard chart for 24 weeks, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. on 22 April 1974.\n            In 1973 Redbone released the politically oriented &quot;We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee&quot;, recalling the massacre of Lakota Sioux Indians by the Seventh Cavalry in 1890. The song ends with the subtly altered sentence &quot;We were all wounded 'by' Wounded Knee&quot;. It charted in several European countries and reached the #1 position in The Netherlands but did not chart in the U.S. where it was initially withheld from release and then banned by several radio stations.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94e825536277aa552fabe6617c651b6074d28f1","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+258","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94e825536277aa552fabe6617c651b6074d28f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,78,130,85,54,39,122,165,82,250,190,102,23,198,81,182,7,77,40,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

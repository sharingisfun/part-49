Title)   \n\nThe Challenger End Fight:\n[youtube]ArWUXL8d93U[/youtube]\n\n\nPLOT:\nTwo top class kung fu fighters challenge all the top kung fu masters in the land, one motivated by revenge, the other by greed. The two fighters team up to face their ultimate challenge in the form of Master Pao, played by Philip Ko.\n\n\nREVIEW:\nAlso known as Deadly Challenger, this all-star gem, produced by Lo Wei, doesn't get the credit it deserves. The directorial debut of Eric Tsang, its a force to be reckoned with. As is Norman Chu, another undercredited individual, and one of the finest villains ever.\n\nChik Ngai Hung and Huang Ha provide action choreoaphy, and its top notch. A little bit of one-at-a-time syndrome in the group fights, but nothing substandard for the time. Norman Chu is fast, dispatching all comers with really sharp and smooth moves. Long takes with intricate choreography comprise each and every fight scene, and although some of the screen fighters (like Huang Ha at the beginning) are a bit slow, the action is glorious. The only complaint can be a shortage of acrobatics up until the finale (which are few and far between, and amped up like mad for the final fight). \n\nChiang is also handled flawlessly. It is impossible to tell that David Chiang is not a legit martial artist. His work here (as evident from even his first encounter with Norman Chu) is probably his best and most fluid outside of Shaolin Mantis. \n\nPhilip Ko Fei's role is textbook, but gets in a decent knifefight with Chiang, culminating in an excellent hand-t0-hand duel spanning various locations. He also goes one-on-one with Norman Chu in an exquisite display of handwork. But the climax lives up to every standard the movie establishes beforehand, and then some. \n\nThe finale is first class, featuring Chiang taking on all-comers in a monstrous staff fight (everyone has a staff). Norman Chu joins in and then they take on everyone with big wooden ring weapons. Then Chiang and Chu tag-team Ko Fei before simultaneously taking him on. The choreorgaphy, excecution, speed, full-contact power, and an array of acrobatic manuevers all incredible. One of the finest finales ever. An unusually dark ending punctuates the movie. \n\nThe typical dopey comedy is in full swing, with some absolutely outrageous segments. It's not as much slapstick as it is situational, and Tsang has his flavor stamped on everything (quite different than Jackie Chan's or Sammo Hung's for example). \n\nThe story is a retread, with a master (Norman Chu in this case) going around martial arts schools and challenging instructors to contests, defeating them all. Slowly his motivations are unraveled, with the mischievous Chiang getting in the mix. Then the classic two-on-one finale after a slew of henchman. Had the plot (and exposition) not been so bland, The Challenger would indeed have approached masterpiece territory, as the action is as solid as it gets, and in no short supply. \n\nClassic kung fu at its best.\n\n\n\nINFO:\nTiTLE......[ The Challenger\nRUNTiME....[ 01:28:00\niMDB URL...[ [url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081630/[/url]\n\nAUDiO......[ MP3 48000Hz 128 kb/s CBR (2 chnls)\nLANGUAGE...[ English Dubbed\nViDEO......[ 1,131 kbps Divx 29.970 FPS \nQ.

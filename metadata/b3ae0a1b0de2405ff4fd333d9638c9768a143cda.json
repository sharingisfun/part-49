One day, the band received a microphone as the present from a mysterious fan. Miraculously, the microphone was a time-machine that accidentally took them to the future, in 2007, where the modern music rules and they're just an out-of-date item. The only way to bring them back to their glorious time is performing a concert to energize the microphone, the time-machine. But, before the concert could be set, there're still some problems in the new world that they have to deal with.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ae0a1b0de2405ff4fd333d9638c9768a143cda","amp;dn":"Kao....Kao+2006+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ae0a1b0de2405ff4fd333d9638c9768a143cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,174,10,27,13,226,64,95,244,253,51,61,150,56,201,118,138,20,60,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

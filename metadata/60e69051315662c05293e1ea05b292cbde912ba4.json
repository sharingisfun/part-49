A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 6: The Cauldron Boils\n\nThe Wehrmacht thrusts south toward the oil fields of the Caucasus. On pain of death, Stalin specifically prohibits any retreat on the battlefield. The formation of the infamous Penal Battalions starts and the battle for Stalingrad begins.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e69051315662c05293e1ea05b292cbde912ba4","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60e69051315662c05293e1ea05b292cbde912ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,230,144,81,49,86,98,192,82,147,225,234,5,178,146,203,222,145,43,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A skilful mixture \nbetween the cosmic vapors of Biospherical Imagery and the \nfierceness of Kindred Spirits. Not that Space Time Continuum has a \nviolent temperament. It sails between random and the minimalism \nwith melancholic exhalations.\n\nThe title track reveals a very spacey cosmic intro where a voice \nannounces with regret, nothing can be done, or change. The tonality \nis equal to what the waltzing images of 2001 A Space Odyssey \ninduced; a kind cosmico-dramatic fusion on calm, but arid, ethereal. \nThe slow orchestral movements sail on a gloomy sea. Follows, a \nbeautiful line with ascending reflections which cascades with softness, \nmaintaining this chimerical vision of a space drama. The rhythm is soft \nand move slowly in spiral, like an abstract voyage in a synthesize \nsinuosity. A bit as Phaedra, a beautiful ghostly flute floods the \nemptiness. This opens a passage to heavy percussions, with hasten \nbeats, moulding finely to a minimalism carrousel which filters its melody \nthrough synths with piercing and etching solos.\nGhost in the Machine offers an atonic and spacey opening, to sound \neffects with twisty and eclectic vocal breaths, as a crumpling of \nemotions. The movement settles with slowness, as if we look at an \ninterstellar ballet where the gravitational movements are of a poetic \ntangibility. Light percussions install a sober rhythmic march, dress by \nbeautiful languorous solos and short mislaid melodies to livid colors.\nThe crystalline flutes of Cryogenics start a parallel structure to Ghost \nin the Machine. Tasty the intro permutes in a nervous and \nhiccoughing sequence about the 5th minute mark. The world of \nCreate becomes more agitate and offers a dense and animate \nmusical coloring. Mellotrons are dancing on haphazard sequences, but \nstructured on a steady rhythm, offering the best ingredients of a \ncorrosive and mocking Create. \nFootprints in the Sand starts quietly; amber-colored and fluty Mellotron \nwhich sails between the worlds of TD, Phaedra style, and Air Sculpture \nbefore offering an intense and insistent sequential movement. The \nsonorous impulsion is slow, but rushes by heavy spiral sequencer \nwhich progresses on increasingly dense and rhythmic cylindrical \ntangents layers. An impressive musical journey which circulates \nthrough superb corridors, to ghostly and orchestral synths. The \ncomparison with the nebulas waves of TD, at the time of Phaedra and \nForce Majeur, is impossible to circumvent. By far, the best part on \nSTC. \nIt is all with carefully that Fading Lights grow Brighter finishes Create \n5th opus of. Strongly atmospheric, nebulosity of sphere of influences \nis heavy and is heartfelt on a space march on dubious tempos. \n\nAfter each Create album, we are amaze to mention it has to be his \nbest. As if Stephen Humphries controls the art to mark-down and \ninnovate. In fact, the English synthesist is unaware of the rules of \nmembership, in order to have a better modelling of him with the \nprogressive passion that dictates him his approach. \nA more contemporary writing where his emotions are etch with heart, \nsense and heat. Space Time Continuum is a sublime cosmic voyage \non nervous and arrogant sequencers, an element which follows Create \nto each creation. \n\n2007. Sylvain Lupari / Canada \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b474cdb280f864847cd4935039f20681b9806f","amp;dn":"Create+-+Space+Time+Continuum+%5BNew+Age+EM+2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b474cdb280f864847cd4935039f20681b9806f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,180,116,205,178,128,248,100,132,124,212,147,80,57,242,6,129,185,128,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

As most Bet Selector users are aware, several manual adjustments need to be made to update the data to take into consideration wet tracks, jockeys, past form, distance, barrier position and track capability for each runner. This is a time consuming exercise and accuracy can be compromised in an attempt to save time. After many years of manually making these adjustments, a fully automated program has now been completed that will reduce many hours of analysis down to minutes with uncanny accuracy.

PPFA Quaddie Buster will then produce the Ticket Text required to place the bet.

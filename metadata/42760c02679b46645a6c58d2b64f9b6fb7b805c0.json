This usually means that the silly explorer.exe or some other process has opened a handle to the file and forgot to close it.\n\nI made a program for such situations- its called ForceDelete.\n\nNow all you need to do is drag-drop any files/folders onto the ForceDel icon and they&amp;#039;ll be deleted immediately smile.gif\n\nOr you can double click the ForceDel icon and it&amp;#039;ll stay in your system tray. When you try to delete files that are in use, ForceDel will kick in and delete the file for you!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42760c02679b46645a6c58d2b64f9b6fb7b805c0","amp;dn":"Forcedel+-+to+unlock+and+delete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42760c02679b46645a6c58d2b64f9b6fb7b805c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,118,12,2,103,155,70,100,90,108,88,210,182,79,155,111,183,184,5,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

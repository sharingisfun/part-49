You Home\n\n        Tomas,  a frail,  shy eight-year-old  boy, has  been living  a\n        solitary life in a  drab orphanage sad, friendless  and alone.\n        Then a  joyous burst  of colour  comes into  his world:  Maire\n        O'Donnell, whose smile  and spirit light  up the darkest  room\n        and Tomas's  heart. Before  he knows  it, Tomas  is on a boat,\n        sailing to wind-swept Corrie Island off the coast of  Ireland,\n        where he meets Alec, her reticent husband who cannot hide  his\n        disappointment with the boy.\n\n        Undiscouraged, Maire  introduces Tomas  to the  wonders of his\n        new world. She  shares with him  the secret of  the seals, the\n        mystery of  the stone  giant and  shows him  that you can find\n        magic  anywhere-  if  you  really  look.  In  this  rugged and\n        enchanting world, Tomas thrives. He befriends a pair of island\n        children and rescues  an orphan seal  pup who join  him on his\n        journey of self-discovery. Slowly,  Alec too begins to  see in\n        Tomas what Maire always has.\n\n        But when  tragedy strikes,  Tomas is  faced with  his greatest\n        challenge yet, for he will lose everything unless he can  find\n        and  share the  magic that's  inside him.  Risking all,  Tomas\n        embarks on a  perilous journey where  he will need  to call on\n        all of Maire's gifts to triumph and come home.\n\n        A  Shine of  Rainbows is  a story  about the  transformational\n        power of  love- about  finding acceptance,  discovering magic,\n        and  about  realizing that  rainbows  are all  around  you and\n        within you, too.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                  Connie Nielsen     ....

Rosselini's 'Chastity' ('Illibatezza') deals with an attractive air hostess who receives the unwelcome attentions of a middle aged American. Godard's 'New World' ('Il Nuovo Mondo') illustrates a post-apocalypse world the same as the pre-apocalyptic one but for an enigmatic change in attitude in most people, including the central character's girlfriend. In Pasolini's 'Curd Cheese' ('La Ricotta'), a lavish film about the life of Jesus Christ is being made in a poor area. The impoverished people subject themselves to various indignities in the name of moviemaking in order to win a little food. The central character is hoisted up on a cross for filming, and dies there. Finally comes Gregoretti's 'Free Range Chicken' ('Il Pollo Ruspante') in which a family of the materialist culture inadvertantly illustrate the cynical, metallic voiced doctrine of a top sales theorist. \n\n------\n\nOrignal DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055f0c8b47abee38fe6c99ed6abc2fc9244811a0","amp;dn":"Laviamoci+il+cervello+-+Ro.Go.Pa.G.+%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055f0c8b47abee38fe6c99ed6abc2fc9244811a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,95,12,139,71,171,238,56,254,108,153,237,106,188,47,201,36,72,17,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

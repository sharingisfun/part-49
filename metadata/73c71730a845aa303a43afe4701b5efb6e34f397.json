Are you on top of your game in Flight Simulator? If not, look no further than Angle of Attack!\n\nThe PMDG 747-400 is one of the most amazing aircraft ever made for flight simulator. This is why we have chosen to train YOU in this aircraft. We teach you all you need to know to go from point A to point B.\n\nAirline pilots in the real world are required to be on top of their game at all times. Many considerations are given to performing a successful flight. With years of experience, these pilots take us safely around the world. Inevitably, virtual pilots need training as well. Otherwise, the aircraft cannot be operated properly. Besides, realism is what you're after, right?\n\nWhat if there is a thunderstorm up ahead? Do you know how to get around this monster? How about an engine failure on takeoff? Can you handle it? Say your destination airport is reporting visibility less than 1/4 with heavy snow. Can you handfly an ILS approach in those conditions? Many would answer 'probably' to these questions. Probably in the aviation world is not good enough! You deserve training!\n\nThe PMDG 747-400 Training Package has an array of new features, along with the well known layout which AoA has become known for. Sections and Procedures included are as follows:\n\n  \nSystems\n  \nSystems Training is presented with an emphasis on Autoflight logic and FMS operation. Roughly an hour and a half is spent showing the many features of the FMC alone! And that's just the start!\n  \nFlying with Glass- MCP, PFD, ND and FMS\nAir Systems\nAnti-Ice and Rain Protection\nAutomatic Flight\nCommunications\nElectrical\nEngines and APU\nFire Protection\nFlight Controls\nFuel\nHydraulics\nLanding Gear\n  \nProcedures\n  \nProcedures are critical operations that deserve special attention. These procedures mainly deal with the more dangerous parts of flying; Takeoffs and Landing. \n \n\nTakeoffs\nNormal Takeoff Technique\nLow Speed Abort\nHigh Speed Abort\nTakeoff Emergency with Fuel Dump and Holding\nApproaches\nCDAP- Constant Descent Approach Procedures\nNon-Precision Approaches\nVOR with Sidestep into Paris\nLOC into Gatwick\nVisual Approach into Princess Juliana\nPrecision Approaches\nCATI ILS by Hand into Toronto\nCATIII Autoland into Dubai\nGo Around into Denver\n  \nFull Flight\n  \nTo finish this DVD, we take you on a Full Flight from Preflight in San Francisco, USA through Shutdown in Frankfurt, Germany. This portion of the DVD will show many of the things not discussed earlier in the procedures, and will also show, in real time, advanced features of this aircraft.\n \n\nPreflight and Fuel Planning\nCaptain on the Flight Deck!\nInitialization\nPreflight Preparations\nBefore Start\nPushback and Startup\nTaxi\nTakeoff\nClimb\nCruise\nTank-to-Engine Switch\nNorth Atlantic Tracks\nDescent/Arrival Planning\nDescent\nApproach\nLanding\nTaxi-In\nShutdown\nSecure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c71730a845aa303a43afe4701b5efb6e34f397","amp;dn":"FS2004%28FSX%29-Angle+of+Attack+PMDG+747-Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c71730a845aa303a43afe4701b5efb6e34f397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,199,23,48,168,69,170,48,58,67,175,228,112,27,94,251,110,52,243,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

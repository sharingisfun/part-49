As most of these are pretty big, I will slow down older torrents for now until these are fully seeded.\n\nGame Name: Wii The Hardy Boys - The Hidden Theft\nGame ID  : [RYNP6V]\nLanguage : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType     : Adventure\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 700+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard - that was so crap I deleted it straight away, so not got that anyway!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce444558ddb1a24bf8cf2a7dd1381069c736431","amp;dn":"Wii+The+Hardy+Boys+-+The+Hidden+Theft+%5BRYNP6V%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce444558ddb1a24bf8cf2a7dd1381069c736431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,228,68,85,141,219,26,36,191,140,242,167,221,19,129,6,156,115,100,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

And yet, the album completely holds together as a cohesive album, never seeming scattered or too eclectic; all of the tracks have a certain inscrutable feel to them, impossible to describe but very easy to identify. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a heaviness, even a liveliness, to this music, that makes even Sunroof!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s calmest moments almost unbearably intense and raw. The music gleams and glimmers as beautifully as a new carÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s curves in the sun, but it also revs and growls as hard as the ugly engine under the hood.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1903477ecd067062eae2d1d75f6981bb04a879b2","amp;dn":"Sunroof%21+-+Cloudz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1903477ecd067062eae2d1d75f6981bb04a879b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,3,71,126,205,6,112,98,234,226,209,215,95,105,129,187,4,168,121,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

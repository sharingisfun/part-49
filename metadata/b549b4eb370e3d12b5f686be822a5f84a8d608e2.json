Rounding out the crew are the smarmy Wolowitz, who thinks he's as sexy as he is brainy, and Koothrappali, who suffers from an inability to speak in the presence of a woman.\n\nThe show distinguishes itself by being unafraid to toss scientific references and technobabble into an otherwise standard sitcom, even employing a physicist to keep things accurate. In doing so, it allows Sheldon and Leonard to do for science what Frasier's Crane brothers did for fine dining, art, and opera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b549b4eb370e3d12b5f686be822a5f84a8d608e2","amp;dn":"The.Big.Bang.Theory.Season.1.and.2.Pack.720p.HDTV.x264.RoSubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b549b4eb370e3d12b5f686be822a5f84a8d608e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,73,180,235,55,14,61,18,181,246,134,190,130,42,95,132,168,214,8,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Starfish's co-founder Sonia Lee Kahn designed the look and feel of Sidekick 95, which was launched simultaneously with Windows 95 with great success. In 1998 Philippe Kahn and Sonia Lee Kahn sold Starfish to Motorola for $325 Million in a private transaction. Software and trademark were sold to become a division of Motorola. Starfish was later bought by Nokia who discontinued the product, with Sidekick 99 being the last version. T-Mobile USA, Inc. currently owns the Sidekick trademark portfolio.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n\nAll Windows versions up to &quot;Windows 8.1&quot; (x32/x64)\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n(1) Place &quot;STARFISH&quot; folder in &quot;C:&quot; drive\n\nC:STARFISH\n\n(2) Go into DISK1 &quot;folder&quot; and click on &quot;Setup.exe&quot;\n\n(3) After installation copy files from &quot;PATCH&quot; folder to installation directory replacing existing ones.\n\nC:Program Files (x86)StarfishSidekick 98program*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072876b7d46c8b9bb3b43401705ba500330dc837","amp;dn":"Borland+Sidekick+98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072876b7d46c8b9bb3b43401705ba500330dc837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,40,118,183,212,108,139,155,179,180,52,1,112,91,165,0,51,13,200,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

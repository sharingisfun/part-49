Backed by the likes of Austrian keyboardist/producer Peter Wolf and a cast of West Coast studio musicians, they&amp;#039;ve produced several albums of high energy dance pop. Although their 1985 debut was a polished set that produced two Top 40 singles (&quot;We Close Our Eyes&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Look Down&quot;), their biggest hit was &quot;King of Wishful Thinking&quot; from the Pretty Woman soundtrack.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review\n\nThis album has a fine mix of power pop and soulful ballads aswell as &amp;#039;The King of Wishful Thinking&amp;#039; from the Pretty Woman film soundtrack. This album was five years in the making and ,on the whole the time was well spent.One or two tracks are obvious fillers and should have been left on the cutting room floor but the rest stand up well with Cox in fine vocal form.\nIf you watched the recent &amp;#039;Reborn in the USA&amp;#039;series and liked Peter Coxs&amp;#039; vocal style then you won&amp;#039;t go far wrong with this album.\n\nEnjoy.

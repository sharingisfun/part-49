The most well known version was shot in 1986 and featured the Blue Angels performing a variety of aerial stunts. The other two videos were shot in March 1993 from a live performance at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California, to celebrate the band's return to the venue after 15 years. (They last played at the venue in 1978.) One version of the video features newscasters and interviews with fans lining up outside the venue before the performance. The second version features far less commentary and more focus on the performance itself. This is the version being shared here. The second version can be seen at VH1Classic.com.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n09 Dreams - Van Halen\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:04:39\n\nBit Rate:\n1501k\n\nFile Size:\n49.99 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1371k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x528\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.36:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n29.97fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f03776c00b36ffe47b2f7a116acd02cf0c3ed99","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f03776c00b36ffe47b2f7a116acd02cf0c3ed99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,3,119,108,0,179,111,254,71,178,247,161,22,172,208,44,240,195,237,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

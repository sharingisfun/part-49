Darrell has diabetes and needs a new kidney. For the last five years, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spent four hours a day, six days a week hooked up to a dialysis machine. So why havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t DarrellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family members gotten tested to see if theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a match for donating a much-needed kidney? And, Natalie Cole may be a world-renowned, Grammy Award-winning singer, but she is also a survivor of life-threatening hepatitis C and kidney failure. In her memoir, Love Brought Me Back, Natalie opens up about the ordeal that changed her life forever and offers a message of hope and healing to anyone who has ever faced tragedy. The songstress shares the fateful day when she received a kidney. Meet the family of NatalieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s donor, and find out why they made the tough decision to donate their loved oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organs. Plus, meet parents struggling with the decision to allow their 11-year-old daughter to continue with her love of gymnastics, even though the sport is detrimental to her health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5572ca680f2709198f83fd0371b7d1b1642a1d5","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2010.12.15.Troubled.Teens.Turnaround.HDTV.Xvid-GRam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5572ca680f2709198f83fd0371b7d1b1642a1d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,87,44,166,128,242,112,145,152,248,63,208,55,27,125,27,22,66,161,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

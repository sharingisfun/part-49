Not for Alf Garnett.  His daughter prefers the company of her Scouce husband, his mates all abandon the pub for their families and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left with Marigold and a cheese sandwich.  Happy Christmas!\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not much that gets AlfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goat more than Christmas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that is if you ignore immigrants, the unions, the Labour party.  Scousers or the price of beer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and every festive season finds him delivering some of his greatest rants.  For a lonely OAP whose pension wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stretch much further than a pint of mild and some pipe tobacco, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to put on the waterworks, wring what he can out of friends, relations and do-gooders ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and spend it down the pub.\n\nThese Christmas specials, broadcast between 1985 and 1990, find Alf in great miserable form and include his last Christmas with Else; his short lived career as a store Santa; his Christmas in hospital for a hip replacement and a disastrous wedding day that leaves Mrs. Hollingbery in a less than festive mood....\n\nStarring: Warren Mitchell, Dandy Nichols, Una Stubbs, Arthur English, Eamonn Walker, Ken Campbell and Carmel McSharry\nWritten by Johnny Speight\nProduced by Roger Race and Richard Boden\nDirected by Roger Race and Richard Boden\n\nOriginally transmitted: 26/12/85, 23/12/86, 25/12/87, 25/12/89, 30/12/90\n\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nMain Soundtrack: English, Stereo\nDisc Format: DVD9\nFeature length: 144 mins approx\nRegion: 2+4 Colour PAL UK\nSubtitles: English for the Hard of Hearing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67df7cf5ed31995513940c7755abc512f6a33477","amp;dn":"In+Sickness+%26+In+Health+-+Christmas+Specials+%5BDVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67df7cf5ed31995513940c7755abc512f6a33477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,223,124,245,237,49,153,85,19,148,12,119,85,171,197,18,246,163,52,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

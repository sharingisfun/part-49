In the struggle for survival, from pathogens to flowers, birds to orangutans, baker's yeast to people, the fittest genomes are those that evolve effective molecular strategies that respond to, and in fact anticipate, challenges and opportunities in their environments. Writing in a clear, accessible style, Lynn Caporale describes the emergence of genomic mutation strategies, which researchers are just beginning to uncover. She also spells out some of the more profound implications of these findings, including the importance of biodiversity, indeed human diversity, for survival, the possibility of bold new directions for medical research, and the inherent dangers of attempting to fix perceived &quot;errors&quot; in a human genome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e17314b44d1da1a1c23952b4fa09c4525cc27100","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2003%5D+Darwin+in+the+Genome+Molecular+Strategies+in+Biolog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e17314b44d1da1a1c23952b4fa09c4525cc27100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,115,20,180,77,29,161,161,194,57,82,180,250,9,196,82,92,194,113,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Since their debut, the soul collective had been struggling\nto regain their position as musical innovators; in the process, they turned out two confused\nalbums that had their moments, but nothing quite as stirring as their initial singles, which were\ncollected on the British-only Volume IV: The Classic Singles. Believe, their fourth album of\noriginal material, doesn't necessarily make a case for Soul II Soul as pioneers in the mid~'90s,\nbut it does represent something of a comeback. Where their two previous albums were\nmuddled affairs, Believe is clear and confident, filled with fully formed songs. It helps that\nJazzie B, the leader of the group, has persuaded former members Caron Wheeler and Penny\nFord to make appearances on the album, and has recruited some genuine new talent that\nhelps spark him into recording his best music since the group's debut. Granted, it doesn't\npush down many boundaries, but Believe fits comfortably into the laid~back, jazz~saturated\ngrooves of '90s RnB. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\n  01. [05:18] - Love Enuff\n  02.

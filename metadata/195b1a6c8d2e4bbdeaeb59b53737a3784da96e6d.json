There remains a fascination with the original\nbandÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s work which  remains to this day and nowhere do peopleÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s opinons polarise\nmore  widely than with the final Mk 4 line-up. They managed three months on  the\nroad before it all fell apart. Speculation as to whether Mk 4 could have ever\nscaled the heights of  their illustrious predecessors is still rife amongst the\nfans.  Both David Coverdale and Jon Lord are on record as defending the\nattempts to carry on with Tommy Bolin, citing the incredible  atmosphere during\nthe ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Come Taste The BandÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶ album rehearsals. The  problem was that none of this\nmaterial had survived. At least that  was thought to be the case.....\n\nJon Lord and Tommy Bolin, 1975Back in 1975 Robert Simon (aka Captain\nCalifornia), after several  years on the road as a sound engineer, set about\nturning an old  studio in Hollywood into a purpose built rehearsal facility.\nNamed  Pirate Sound Studio, bands could set up a full stage rig, and  rehearse\nor jam in a relatively relaxed atmosphere.\n\nRobert had done front of house sound for several Deep Purple tours  and so when\nPurple came off the road in April 1975, Pirate Sound was  booked - somewhere\nthey could regroup and start to address the  problem of Ritchie Blackmore's\nreplacement. Tommy Bolin got the gig,  and the band began to rehearse and write\nfor the next album.  Periodically Robert - handling the mixer desk - would, at\nPurple's  request, bang in a tape, some of which survived but lay forgotten for\ntwenty years.\n\nCracking high energy blasts through some of the &quot;Come Taste The Band&quot;  tracks,\nas well as no holds barred instrumental free-for-alls powered  by Ian Paice, the\nmaterial produced dropped jaws in all who heard bits. It is from these\nrecordings that Days May Come... has been lovingly  assembled. There are early\nversions of songs for the &quot;Come Taste The  Band&quot; album, exhilarating blasts of\nthe band jamming together,  rehearsing or enjoying David CoverdaleÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s painfully\naccurate working menÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s club rendition of Sonny &amp; Cher. All in all a rare treat\nfor  fans, which proves that the final line-up of Deep Purple really did  have\nwhat it takes.\n\nThis special edition with a 12 page colour booklet includes the extra half hour\nof material previously unavailable only via mailorder and  has been extended to\na double disc set.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195b1a6c8d2e4bbdeaeb59b53737a3784da96e6d","amp;dn":"Deep_Purple-Days_May_Come_and_Days_May_Go_%28Special_Edition%29-2CD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195b1a6c8d2e4bbdeaeb59b53737a3784da96e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,91,26,108,141,46,75,189,234,235,89,181,55,55,163,120,77,169,110,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

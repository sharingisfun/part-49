It was written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, with some additional material in early episodes by John Mason, Colin Bostock-Smith, Douglas Adams, John Lloyd and others. The show starred Denise Coffey (series 1 only), Jo Kendall (series 2 onward), Chris Emmett, Nigel Rees and Fred Harris. The series had three producers over the years, announced as &quot;Simon Brett of Stepney&quot;, &quot;John Lloyd of Europe&quot;, and &quot;David 'Hatch of the BBC' Hatch&quot;.\n\nThe series had its roots in a pair of half-hour sketch shows entitled Half-Open University which Marshall and Renwick had written with Mason for Radio 3 as a parody of the real life Open University programmes. The first of these shows, broadcast in August 1976, spoofed science, while the second, in December, lampooned history.\n\nIn a similar vein, The Burkiss Way was originally based around a fictional series of correspondence courses by &quot;Professor Emil Burkiss&quot; entitled The Burkiss way to Dynamic Living, and each episode, or &quot;lesson&quot;, had a number and a title based on one of the course's fictional subjects: &quot;Lesson 1: Peel Bananas the Burkiss Way&quot;, &quot;Lesson 2: Pass Examinations the Burkiss Way&quot;, and so on. Although these numbers and titles were maintained throughout the show's run, an obvious and rapid change of style early in the second series saw the notion of a radio correspondence course become a hook rather than a narrative device, and it was thereafter mentioned only in passing. From here on the programme continued in a more obvious &quot;sketch&quot; format, though it was to use increasingly Pythonesque devices including surreal, stream-of-consciousness linking, back referencing and aggregation. Like the Pythons before them the writers lampooned and tinkered with the very medium on which the show was broadcast. Radio 4's continuity style was often spoofed. Many later episodes had false endings, sometimes cunningly disguised as genuine continuity announcements. Both the opening and closing credits might be placed anywhere within the show. One particular show ran &quot;backwards&quot; from the closing to the opening credits, while another was allegedly dropped and broken, and subsequently glued together with a tube of BBC coffee, resulting in a disjointed running order with many of the sketches beginning and ending in mid-sentence.\n\n\n[b]Notes: The 3 in red in series 01 I have spent some time on cleaning up.\nNot a lot I could do but make them more gentle on your ears.\nYou sould remove the 3 from your Burkiss folder before starting this download.\nOnce your happy they are better; discard the old versions.\nI had many PM's saying The Half-Open University should be included as it's the Pilot, so I have.\n[/b] \n\n\nThe Half-Open University - S01 - E01\nThe Half-Open University - S01 - E02\n\n[color=red]The Burkiss Way - S01 - E01 - Lesson 01 - Peel Bananas The Burkiss Way[/color] \n[color=red]The Burkiss Way - S01 - E02 - Lesson 02 - Pass Examinations The Burkiss Way[/color]\nThe Burkiss Way - S01 - E03 - Lesson 03 - The Burkiss Special With James Burk\nThe Burkiss Way - S01 - E04 - Lesson 04 - Solve Murders The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S01 - E05 - Lesson 05 - Keep Unfit The Burkiss Way\n[color=red]The Burkiss Way - S01 - E06 - Lesson 06 - Win Awards The Burkiss Way[/color]\n\n\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E01 - Lesson 07 - Influence Friends And Win People The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E02 - Lesson 08 - Plan Christmas Schedules The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E03 - Lesson 09 - Gain Spiritual Fulfilment The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E04 - Lesson 10 - Govern Britain The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E05 - Lesson 11 - Journey Into the Unknown The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E06 - Lesson 12 - Make Short Comedy Programmes The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E07 - Lesson 13 - Commemorate The Jubilee The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E08 - Lesson 14 - Do You-Know-What The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E09 - Lesson 15 - Skive From School The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E10 - Lesson 16 - Get Off With Life The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E11 - Lesson 17 - This Is Your Life The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E12 - Lesson 18 - Become A Rock Star The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S02 - E13 - Lesson 19 - Replace The Burkiss Way\n\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E01 - Lesson 20 - Discover Gravity The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E02 - Lesson 21 - Get Cut Off The Bur\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E03 - Lesson 22 - Succeed In Business The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E04 - Lesson 23 - Son Of The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E05 - Lesson 24 - One Hour To The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E06 - Lesson 25 - Not To Be Opened Until Christmas The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E07 - Lesson 26 - First Prize The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E08 - Lesson 27 - Around The World The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E09 - Lesson 28 - Ignore These Programme Titles The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E10 - Lesson 29 - Complain About The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E11 - Lesson 30 - Not The Burkiss Way\nThe Burkiss Way - S03 - E12 - Lesson 31 - Bruces Choice &amp;

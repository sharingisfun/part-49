The file TCPIP.SYS in the directory C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS and C:\\WINDOWS\\SERVICEPACKFILES\\I386 has to be changed (system dependend eventually in C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DLLCACHE, too).\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s been fixed:\nTo say it easy: the before 10 half-open connections are beeing increased to 50 (can be changed during runtime and with the parameter /L) and the CRC is been corrected. And that&amp;#039;s it! (Basiclly it allows more connections; for downloads, etc)\n  \nComments:\nThe method described here, should only be used by users who know how to handle all the described. With the download of this published program the user know that changes are made on third party files. For damages in every kind I cannot be hold responsible for. However tests worked fine here and nothing is impossible.\nInfo: When error occurs, the patcher can change the TCPIP.SYS back to the original, so you should be fine.\n  \nInstructions:\nJust download the patcher and execute it. It will automatically find the windows directory decrease it, if it has already been increased it will then decrease.\nAfter a successful patch, the new TCPIP.SYS will be automatically installed. After that, the computer should be restarted. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d207bae5ac80ad3e242bc68b42f451af719ba352","amp;dn":"TCPIP.Sys+Patch-%5BX3d%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d207bae5ac80ad3e242bc68b42f451af719ba352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,7,186,229,172,128,173,62,36,43,198,139,66,244,81,175,113,155,163,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

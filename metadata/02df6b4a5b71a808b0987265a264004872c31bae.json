SD formatting provides quick and easy access to your SD memory card. This program may only be used on WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2000, WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®.\n\nSD or SDHC memory card file systems formatted with generic operating system formatting software do not comply with official SD memory card requirements and optimum performance may not be experienced. \n\n|\n|\n|\n\nThis formatter was written by Matsushita Electronic (Panasonic) and runs fine under Windows 7.  This corrects many of the &quot;differing and unusual&quot; formatted files sizes when cards are formatted with a computer.  Not tested with the latest 2-TB devices.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02df6b4a5b71a808b0987265a264004872c31bae","amp;dn":"SD%2FSDHC+Formatter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02df6b4a5b71a808b0987265a264004872c31bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,223,107,74,91,113,168,8,176,152,114,101,162,100,0,72,114,195,27,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

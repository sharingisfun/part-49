Where are we? What are we doing here? Who really controls this world and how and why?\n\nIn this seven-hour presentation to 2,500 people at the Brixton Academy in London, David addresses all these questions and connects the dots between them to reveal a picture of life on earth that is truly beyond the cutting edge.\n\nNowhere in the world will you see a presentation like this one, which connects the apparently unconnected to form the tapestry of knowledge that can set us free from our collective enslavement by the hidden powers behind government, banking, business, media and all the other agencies of manipulation and control.\n\nWhat is the connection between ancient history, 9/11, the &quot;war on terror&quot;, the gathering Orwellian nightmare and the nature of reality itself? It seems a strange question to most people, but in fact all are fundamentally linked, as Icke so compellingly reveals.\n\nAs he says: &quot;Without understanding the nature of our experienced reality and how we create it, we cannot truly understand anything else.&quot;\n\nTens of millions around the world have become aware of David Icke and his work as what he has written in a stream of books has become our daily experience.\n\n\n\nFiles:\n\nVideos:\n\nDavid Icke_ Beyond the Cutting Edge - Part 1 _ 3.mp4\nDavid Icke_ Beyond the Cutting Edge - Part 2 _ 3.mp4\nDavid Icke_ Beyond the Cutting Edge - Part 3 _ 3.mp4\n\nAAC, Stereo (L R), 44.100 kHz\nH.264, 480 x 270, Millions\n509.86 kbits/s\napprox. 6 hours 20 min\n\n\nText Files:\n\nDavid-Icke-Children-of-the-Matrix.pdf\n458 pages\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61b13bee377a205904a10e9c50c0a7bd5c70e2e2","amp;dn":"David+Icke+-+Beyond+the+Cutting+Edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61b13bee377a205904a10e9c50c0a7bd5c70e2e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,177,59,238,55,122,32,89,4,161,14,156,80,192,167,189,92,112,226,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

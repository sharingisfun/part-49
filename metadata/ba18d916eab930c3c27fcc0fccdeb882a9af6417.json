After his guilt takes him down a road of despair and alcohol, the encouragement of his proteges forces him to return to work. \n \nOverview: \n\nWing (Jackie Chan) is the Hong Kong police's resident supercop. He's the best of the best, cracking every case he handles in record time. \nFung (Nicholas Tse) is a rebel without a pause, a typically disaffected but street-smart Hong Kong youth who wastes his life in videogame arcades. Talk is cheap, and no one talks cheaper than Fung. \n\nDue to his family's criminal background, it seems that Fung can never become a police officer, and follow in the footsteps of Wing, his all-time idol. \n\nFinally, Fung gets the chance to realise his goal of becoming a detective. He tricks Wing into joining force with him on the trail of a truly vicious band of foes: The Gang Of Five! \n\n \nCast: \n\nJackie Chan  ||  Nicholas Tse (Ting Fung)  ||  Charlie Yeung Choi-Nei (Charlie Young)  ||  Charlene Choi Cheuk-Yin  ||  Daniel Wu Yin-Cho  ||  Wang Chieh  ||  Andy On Chi-Kit  ||  Terence Yin Chi-Wai  ||  Coco Chiang Yi  ||  Hayama Go  ||  Liu Kai Chi  ||  Yu Rong Guang  ||  Deep Ng  ||  Zac Koo (Hau Zheng) \n \nRunning Time: \n\n123 mins.

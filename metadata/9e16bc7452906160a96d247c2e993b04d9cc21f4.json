This year, both the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage in the Arctic were open for ships to pass through for the first time in living memory.\n\nWhat are the causes of this warming? And how will it affect sea level, tropical storms and other aspects of the climate system? And can we stop this warming, and how? These topics will be discussed based on the most recent scientific results, by one of the leading climate scientists in the world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e16bc7452906160a96d247c2e993b04d9cc21f4","amp;dn":"25c3+Tag2+Saal2+ID2863+climate+change+original+dump","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e16bc7452906160a96d247c2e993b04d9cc21f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,22,188,116,82,144,97,96,169,109,36,124,46,153,59,4,217,204,33,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

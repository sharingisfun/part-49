The survivors inhabit a world thrown back two hundred years, a world of crop shortages and civil unrest. A world where the brightest and best of its young people are drawn to the xenophobic Earth United group.\n\nA world sliding into a new Dark Age, believes Susan Campbell, widow of one of the heroes of the Occupation. A world in need of alien intervention. A world in need of hope.\n\nBut as Susan takes drastic action to secure the planet's future, she's oblivious to the fact that her student son, Alex, ensnared by Earth United, is in need of alien intervention too. Or so Alex's great-grandfather thinks.\n\nAUTHOR: Marc Platt \t\nDIRECTOR: Nicholas Briggs\nRELEASE DATE: December 2010\n\n------------------------------\n\nFormat: 160kbps CD-Rip mp3 (20 tracks with front cover JPEG).\n\n------------------------------\n\nRemember - if you get into Big Finish audios and you have spare pennies for entertainment - support them!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b002a25763ea7d7a4047881ff77e3872e4534f","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+%28Big+Finish%29+-+An+Earthly+Child+%28Dec+2009+-+Audio+160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b002a25763ea7d7a4047881ff77e3872e4534f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,176,2,162,87,99,234,125,122,64,71,136,31,247,126,56,114,228,83,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

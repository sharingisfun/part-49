The problem now is that a destructive combination of natural forces and human intrusions is threatening to force the complete collapse of the Titanic wreck into the ocean floor. \n\nThe telecast on 7 June will originate from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship Ronald H. Brown and include the first-ever live telecast from Titanic's watery grave, some 12,000 feet under the Atlantic Ocean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765b49e177ed4bde40c17744fc807bd8534d3849","amp;dn":"NGC+-+The+wreck+of+the+Titanic+-+TV-rip+720x576+-+Dutch+subtitle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765b49e177ed4bde40c17744fc807bd8534d3849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,91,73,225,119,237,75,222,64,193,119,68,252,128,123,216,83,77,56,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

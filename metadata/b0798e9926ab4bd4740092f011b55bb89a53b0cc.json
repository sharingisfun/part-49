On Valentine's Day, Harry awakes from his coma in the local hospital, and he kills twenty-two people, including a group of teenagers that are partying in the mine. Harry is killed by the deputy, but the only survivors are Tom Hanniger, his girlfriend Sarah, their friend Axel Palmer and his girlfriend Irene. Ten years later, Tom returns to Harmony after the death of his father.

On Valentine's Day, Harry Warden also returns, seeking revenge against those that had escaped his pickax in the past...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0798e9926ab4bd4740092f011b55bb89a53b0cc","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine+2009+DVDRip.XViD.AC3.avi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0798e9926ab4bd4740092f011b55bb89a53b0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,121,142,153,38,171,75,212,116,0,146,240,17,181,91,184,154,83,176,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

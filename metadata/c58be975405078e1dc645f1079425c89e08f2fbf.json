Zara is searching for the segments of the Key to Time; she was only born yesterday but already sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s killed hundreds of people. Ace is more ambitious: she was going to kill everyone on the planet.\n\nWhat have they got against the people of Erratoon? They go peaceably about their simple assignments, beneath their artificial sky. They share their meals and leisure time and they never ask questions. Are they even real?\n\nAce and Zara will only survive if they can trust each other. Or perhaps if they sell each other out... If not their awful punishment is to become just like everyone else.\nAUTHOR: \tSimon Guerrier\tDIRECTOR:\tLisa Bowerman\nSOUND DESIGN:\tDavid Darlington\n\tMUSIC:\tDavid Darlington\nCOVER ART:\tSimon Holub\tNUMBER OF DISCS:\t1 CD\nRECORDED DATE:\t16 June 2008\n\tRELEASE DATE:\t30 January 2009\nPRODUCTION CODE:\tBFPDWCC15\tISBN:\t978-1-84435-357-6\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT:\n\nThis special story is a 'cross-over' with the Key 2 Time mini-series.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58be975405078e1dc645f1079425c89e08f2fbf","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Companion+Chronicles+3.8+-+The+Prisioners+Dilem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58be975405078e1dc645f1079425c89e08f2fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,139,233,117,64,80,120,225,220,100,95,16,121,66,92,137,224,143,47,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

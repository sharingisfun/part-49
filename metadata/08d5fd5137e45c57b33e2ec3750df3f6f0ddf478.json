It is stable, easy to use, and requires no knowledge of Linux and only basic computer skills.\n\nSee it in a demo video: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4422887272477313460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4422887272477313460&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThey have been dugg so the sites a bit iffy as are some of the components required by this installer (it can download what is needed from their servers but they&amp;#039;ve taken a hammering).\n\nThey are working on setting up torrents for the ISO though so keep your eyes peeled on the site. There&amp;#039;s a demo video on Google video which they will link to from their site which shows you what it can do.\n\nLooks fantastic, and well worth a try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d5fd5137e45c57b33e2ec3750df3f6f0ddf478","amp;dn":"LinuxMCE+1.0+Insaller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d5fd5137e45c57b33e2ec3750df3f6f0ddf478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,213,253,81,55,228,92,87,179,62,46,195,117,13,243,246,240,221,244,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

For a long time the view of the Germanic - people of many peoples - was distorted by the Germanic cult of the 19th century and the Nazi dictatorship. The series breathes new life into the little known world of the Germanic tribes. We see how they lived, fought, and worshipped their gods. Intricate 3D animation shows us how they built their settlements, buried their kings. The Germanic Tribes portrays the protagonists of an epoch of formative influence for Europe - whose legacy is still with us.\n\nEpisode 1: Barbarians against Rome\nEpisode 2: The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest\nEpisode 3: Pax Romana\nEpisode 4: In the Sign of the Cross\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e958731c94b66a5ded01d001c21e711c22a30fec","amp;dn":"The+Germanic+Tribes+++%282008+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e958731c94b66a5ded01d001c21e711c22a30fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,88,115,28,148,182,106,93,237,1,208,1,194,30,113,28,34,163,15,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

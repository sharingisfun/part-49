The murders start afresh, investigated by the Candian mounties (even though the film is set in Indiana - a clever poke at the US set but Canadian made slashers). Alfred Sole (the director of the excellent proto-slasher ALICE SWEET ALICE) directed this hit and miss spoof that is bolstered by good performances, especially by Carol Kane as the final girl.\n\nPretty good VHS rip from PAL tape.

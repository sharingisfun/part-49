These applications need to continuously process large amounts of data coming in the form of a stream, and meet stringent response time requirements. Support for handling QoS metrics, such as response time, memory usage, and throughput, is central to any system proposed for the above applications.\n\nStream Data Processing: A Quality of Service Perspective (Modeling, Scheduling, Load Shedding, and Complex Event Processing), presents a new paradigm suitable for stream and complex event processing. This book covers a broad range of topics in stream data processing and includes detailed technical discussions of a number of proposed techniques.\n\nThis volume is intended as a textbook for graduate courses and as a reference book for researchers, advanced-level students in CS, and IT practitioners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3bca6b645940860704cb075e358a81ed411dd2","amp;dn":"Stream+Data+Processing%3A+A+Quality+of+Service+Perspective%3A+Modeli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3bca6b645940860704cb075e358a81ed411dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,59,202,107,100,89,64,134,7,4,203,7,94,53,138,129,237,65,29,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

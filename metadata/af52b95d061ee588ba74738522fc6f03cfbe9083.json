After a few member changes Captain Insano have never settled on a sound that they are happy with and will continue to experiment and evolve as a unit. In 2005, Captain Insano released their E.P. &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The Inevitable Conclusion To A Wasted Life&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, from which &amp;#039;Doombuggy&amp;#039; is taken.

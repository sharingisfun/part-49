H. Auden teamed up with the New York Pro Musica Antiqua in 1954 to make this record.  \n\nAuden reads a piece of verse in his usual simple, clear style, then the Pro Musica Antiqua sings the same piece.  Each illuminates the other, and it is pure pleasure to listen to.  \n\nThe music is a mix of madrigals and lute songs.  Among the verses are &quot;Tan Tara Cries Mars&quot;, &quot;Sweet Honey Sucking Bees&quot;, &quot;In Darkness Let Me Dwell&quot;, &quot;When Absalom Was Slain&quot; - it's clear the selections were made by Auden, a fine poet himself. The liner notes by Auden are included. \n\nIf you're a fan of Elizabethan music, or if you're just Elizabethan-curious, this is an excellent addition to your collection. \n\nThe recording is monaural, but it is of adequate technical quality, and the performance can never be duplicated.  \n\nThis has never been re-issued on CD - these FLAC datasets were ripped from an original 1954 vinyl recording; the scratches and pops have been removed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa24f5a7247325b38caf24bd6437941475a6bde3","amp;dn":"W.+H.+Auden+-+An+Evening+Of+Elizabethan+Verse+and+It%5C%27s+Music+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa24f5a7247325b38caf24bd6437941475a6bde3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,36,245,167,36,115,37,179,140,175,36,189,100,55,148,20,117,166,189,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didn't expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she's ever met. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them, Edward must fight to save Bella. A modern, visual, and visceral Romeo and Juliet story of the ultimate forbidden love affair - between vampire and mortal.\n\nPlease seed and do write some comments on the quality!!\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5889419fddebba414e6a1fb53a7122df4b8530e3","amp;dn":"Twilight+2008+%5BSubs%2C+Soundtrack%2C+Novels+Included%5D+DvDrip-soagg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5889419fddebba414e6a1fb53a7122df4b8530e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,137,65,159,221,235,186,65,78,106,31,181,58,113,34,223,75,133,48,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

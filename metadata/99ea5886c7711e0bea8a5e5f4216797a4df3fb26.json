Unlike cats, which have only nine\nlives, bluebears have twenty-seven. This is fortunate, because our hero\nis forever avoiding disaster by a paw's breadth. In this remarkable\nbook, Captain Bluebear tells the story of his first thirteen-and-a-half\nlives spent on the mysterious continent of Zamonia, where intelligence\nis an infectious disease and water flows uphill, where headless giants\nroam deserts made of sugar, and where only Captain Bluebear's courage\nand ingenuity enable him to escape the dangers that lie in wait for\nhim around every corner. In company with our indomitable hero, we enter\na realm of the imagination that combines the fantasy of The Lord of\nthe Rings and The Neverending Story with the humour of Baron Munchausen,\nand where anything can exist except boredom. It's a land of imaginative\nlunacy and supreme adventure, wicked satire and epic fantasy, all mixed\ntogether and turned on its head. Playful enough for young adult readers,\nyet as intricate and engaging as any work of literary fiction, The 13\n1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebear has the plot of a novel and the spontaneity\nand humor of a vintage comic book, making it an instant international \n\nRead By Bronson Pinchot\nUnabridged.\n\n-----------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ea5886c7711e0bea8a5e5f4216797a4df3fb26","amp;dn":"The+13.5+Lives+of+Captain+Bluebear+-+Walter+Moers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ea5886c7711e0bea8a5e5f4216797a4df3fb26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,234,88,134,199,113,30,11,234,138,94,95,66,22,121,122,77,243,251,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

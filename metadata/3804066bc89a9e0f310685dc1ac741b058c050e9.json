Their label, Tetragrammaton, had gone bankrupt, and the group had moved to Warner Brothers. Changes in band members found the classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up of vocalist Ian Gillan, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, keyboardist Jon Lord, bassist Roger Glover, and drummer Ian Paice in place. Gone also were the cover songs and orchestration of their earlier releases. Deep Purple was now poised to help create a new brand of rock &amp; roll known as hard rock, which would ultimately become heavy metal. Meanwhile, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were achieving massive sales and changing the face of modern music.\nThough In Rock did not sell well in the United States and only placed at number 143 on the national charts, it was a big hit in England and reached number four on their charts.\nWhat set Deep Purple apart from their contemporaries was the speed of many of their songs, plus the dual organ-guitar blitz which provided the foundation for their sound.\nÃƒÂ¢??Speed KingÃƒÂ¢?? leads off the album with a blast of frenetic fury. Ian Gillian shrieks, ÃƒÂ¢??IÃƒÂ¢??m a speed king, see me flyÃƒÂ¢?? as Blackmore and Lord duel on guitar and organ. BlackmoreÃƒÂ¢??s guitar playing established his and PurpleÃƒÂ¢??s sound with this very first song, and it remains a staple of the groupÃƒÂ¢??s live act (and is still played at hyper speed.)\nÃƒÂ¢??BloodsuckerÃƒÂ¢?? is very much a Ritchie Blackmore song. Ian Gillan provides a competent vocal, but it is BlackmoreÃƒÂ¢??s continuing quest to establish himself as a force in rock music that drives the song. This track looks ahead to BlackmoreÃƒÂ¢??s later group Rainbow.\nSide one of the original album release ends with the classic ÃƒÂ¢??Child In Time.ÃƒÂ¢?? This ten minute tour-de-force remains a Deep Purple signature song. ItÃƒÂ¢??s particularly nice to hear a more mellow vocal style by Gillan. The instrumental sound runs counter to the harmony as Blackmore and Lord take the sound in an almost a neo-classical direction.\nThe second half of In Rock is not as strong as the first. ÃƒÂ¢??Into The FireÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??Living WreckÃƒÂ¢?? both have odd structures, and Blackmore and Gillan give only fair performances. ÃƒÂ¢??Flight Of The RatÃƒÂ¢?? is better as it returns the group to a frenetic mode and allows Jon Lord some room for improvisation. ÃƒÂ¢??Hard LovinÃƒÂ¢?? ManÃƒÂ¢?? ends the album on an average note, almost as if the group has expended its energy.\nIn Rock would set the table for a long career on the part of Deep Purple. Two classic songs and two more very good ones allow this album to remain a pleasurable listening experience -- and donÃƒÂ¢??t forget to turn it up loud. \n\nReview taken from allmusic.com:\nAfter satisfying all of their classical music kinks with keyboard player Jon Lord&amp;#039;s overblown Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Deep Purple&amp;#039;s soon to be classic Mark II version made its proper debut and established the sonic blueprint that would immortalize this lineup of the band on 1970&amp;#039;s awesome In Rock. The cacophony of sound (spearheaded by Ritchie Blackmore&amp;#039;s blistering guitar solo) introducing opener &quot;Speed King&quot; made it immediately obvious that the band was no longer fooling around, but the slightly less intense &quot;Bloodsucker&quot; did afford stunned listeners a chance to catch their breaths before the band launched into the album&amp;#039;s epic, ten-minute tour de force, &quot;Child in Time.&quot; In what still stands as arguably his single greatest performance, singer Ian Gillan led his bandmates on a series of hypnotizing crescendos, from the song&amp;#039;s gentle beginning through to its ear-shattering climax and then back again for an even more intense encore that brought the original vinyl album&amp;#039;s seismic first side to a close. Side two opened with the searing power chords of &quot;Flight of the Rat&quot; -- another example of the band&amp;#039;s new take-no-prisoners hard rock stance, though at nearly eight minutes, it too found room for some extended soloing from Blackmore and Lord. Next, &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Living Wreck&quot; proved more concise but equally appealing, and though closer &quot;Hard Lovin&amp;#039; Man&quot; finally saw the new-look Deep Purple waffling on a bit too long before descending into feedback, the die was cast for one of heavy metal&amp;#039;s defining albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3804066bc89a9e0f310685dc1ac741b058c050e9","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+In+Rock+%281970%29+%281995+25th+Ann.+Edition%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3804066bc89a9e0f310685dc1ac741b058c050e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,4,6,107,200,154,158,15,49,6,133,220,26,199,65,176,88,192,80,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

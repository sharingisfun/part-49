Finding that washing in the blood of young girls makes her young again she gets Dobi to start abducting likely candidates. The Countess - pretending to be her own daughter - starts dallying with a younger man, much to Dobi's annoyance. The disappearances cause mounting terror locally, and when she finds out that only the blood of a virgin does the job, Dobi is sent out again with a more difficult task.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 688x416 - 23.976fps - 1h 33mn 20s 729ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc192282a8aab1020c8957d2d500e47b50e9a4a","amp;dn":"Countess+Dracula+%5B1971%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc192282a8aab1020c8957d2d500e47b50e9a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,193,146,40,42,138,171,16,32,200,149,125,45,80,14,71,181,14,154,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

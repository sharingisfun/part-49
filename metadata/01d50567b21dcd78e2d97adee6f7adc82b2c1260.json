Brian places Fireaxe's music in the public domain - distribute at will but don't make a profit and credit the music accordingly.\n\nTold in nine parts &quot;Eternal Devotion to the Dark Goddess&quot; is the story\nof a man's life, of his naive and hopeful beginnings, of his disillusionment\nand drive to succeed at all costs, and of his fall and quest for retribution.\nThe protagonist's tale is a journey through a world where sadism, deceit, and\nexploitation lay waiting behind every shining promise. It is a tale of\ncut-throat capitalism, of torture and abuse of power, and of the desperate\nstruggle to preserve love and purity in a world of lust and debauchery, but\nmostly it is about lies and how they are used to create and destroy.

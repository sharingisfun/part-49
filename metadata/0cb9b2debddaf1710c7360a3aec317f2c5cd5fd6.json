The following track, Pale Horses,\nand 2nd single, continues to set the tone for the record with Amelia Zirin Brown\nadding, &quot;Put me on the train, send me back to my home. Couldn't live without you\nwhen I tried to roam. Put me by the window. Let me see outside. Looking at the\nplaces where all my family died.&quot;\n\nThe album's first single, while being instrumental, again confronts the ongoing\nsadness that is evident throughout the record. Shot In The Back Of The Head\nreveals an interesting inverted loop that works beneath moaning guitar to lend\na picture of moroseness to the music.\n\nWalk with Me continues by utilizing vocals that sound almost like weeping.\nMistake is the album's first vocal track. Where Moby has made a habit of tossing\nin a few outliers on his albums, the relaxed Mistake is oddly about as far from\nthe norm as Wait For Me gets musically.\n\nThe album continues through similar trends, JLTF 1 is a beautiful track that\nblends deliberate piano with melancholic lyrics, Hope Is Gone is a slow burning\nballad, Ghost Return and Slow Light deliver gloomy keys and Isolate concludes\nthe record with a tone similar to Shot In The Back Of The Head, if only with a\nless energy and a single violin playing in the background.\n\nRegardless of history and intent, what Moby has created with Wait For Me is\nintensely personal. While the tone of the album's songs are consistently\nreflective, and strikingly dark, as a whole they represent a piece of music that\nis the most thorough Moby has created in a decade.\nAt times you hear Play, and at times you hear Everything Is Wrong, but at no\ntime can you hear a track that is truly expected.\n\nOut June 30th","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cb9b2debddaf1710c7360a3aec317f2c5cd5fd6","amp;dn":"Moby-Wait_For_Me-CD-2009-TGX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cb9b2debddaf1710c7360a3aec317f2c5cd5fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,185,178,222,189,218,241,113,12,115,96,163,174,195,23,242,197,205,95,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

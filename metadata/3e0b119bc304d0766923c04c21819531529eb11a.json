Estamos falando do renomado Doutor Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), protagonista da sÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rie de TV HOUSE M.D. exibida pelo canal Universal Channel da NET.\n\nAvesso ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  qualquer tipo de regra e sempre pronto a quebrar paradigmas o doutor House ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© a antÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­tese completa daquele bondoso mÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©dico de famÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­lia que atende sempre as pessoas com um sorriso no rosto e uma imensa dose de paciÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âªncia. Ele simplesmente nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o suporta conviver com os pacientes e sempre parte do princÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­pio de que todo mundo mente. \\&quot;Existe sempre uma razÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o\\&quot; - diz ele.\n\nEsse ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© apenas um dos muitos atrativos da sÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rie. Descartando a hipocrisia, House sempre prefere deixar tudo em pratos limpos e letras grandes. NÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o suporta pieguice, odeia falso moralismo e passa por cima de tudo quando o assunto ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© salvar a vida dos seus pacientes, para o desespero da Dra. Cuddy, administradora do Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n \nPara alguns, House ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© um obcecado pelo quebra-cabeÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§a imposto pelas doenÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§as e nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o propriamente pelo paciente em si. Em vÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡rios momentos inclusive ele ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© acusado de nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o dar importÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ncia ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ vida das pessoas e deixar-se levar pelo fascÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­nio das descobertas como se tudo fosse um jogo. No entanto, ele se importa sim, mas ao seu modo. Ele apenas nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o deseja se envolver com as pessoas nem saber das histÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³rias delas, o que fazem, o que pensam, etc. ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ desse modo que ele funciona - e funciona bem - sem entrar nos \\&quot;detalhes patÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ticos da vida dos outros\\&quot; como sempre diz.\n\nEle simplesmente nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o transparece sua preocupaÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o nem seu apreÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§o pelas pessoas, mas sim protege-se de tais sentimentos com uma indefectÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­vel couraÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§a de sarcasmo. Mas se importa sim ! Tanto ou mais do que os outros mÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©dicos. Ele apenas nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o quer ser visto se importando, sÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ isso. Algumas pessoas o tocam de alguma forma, seja por algo que dizem ou por terem histÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³rias parecidas ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ dele. Sentimentos existem, mas ficam do lado de dentro.\n\nAcompanhado pela sua fiel equipe, os Doutores Chase, Foreman e Cameron e o seu amigo oncologista o Doutor Wilson ( que parece ser o ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âºnico a entendÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âª-lo como pessoa ) ele destrÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³i tudo o que encontrar de ortodoxo pela frente, tanto no plano da medicina como interpessoal, sem nunca contrariar seus princÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­pios. Por isso ele ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© respeitado e odiado por todos na mesma medida. Todos detestam seu jeito de conduzir as coisas, mas, no fundo, sentem um pouquinho de inveja por nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o terem a mesma coragem que House tem para ser \\&quot;House\\&quot;, ou seja, alguÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©m que nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o pode ser comprado nem dissuadido.\n\nHouse definitivamente nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o joga no time dos \\&quot;politicamente corretos\\&quot; e ainda faz pouco de quem joga. Ele estÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ sempre lÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ para provar que dizer e fazer sÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o coisas bem diferentes e que os fins justificam os meios quando se trata de salvar uma vida. Realmente ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© um personagem fascinante em todos os sentidos. Tanto pela sua genialidade quanto pelo seu jeito \\&quot;rabugento carismÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡tico\\&quot; que parece estar sempre em eterno conflito consigo mesmo. \n\nDe um jeito ou de outro, ele sempre conquista a todos. \n\n\nHouse M.D.\nUniversal Channel\nToda Quinta-Feira 23:00 reapresentaÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o aos sÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡bados 19:00 \n\nBios\nHugh Laurie \nDr. Gregory House\nHugh Laurie was born in Oxford, England, and educated at Eton and Cambridge University, where he took a degree in Anthropology.

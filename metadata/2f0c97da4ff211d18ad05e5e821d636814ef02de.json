Web history. Address bar. Suggestions as you type.\nOne unified box serves all your browsing needs.\n\nNew Tab page\n\nEvery time you open a new tab, you'll see a visual sampling of your most visited sites, most used search engines, and recently bookmarked pages and closed tabs.\n\nApplication shortcuts\n\nUse web apps without opening your browser. Application shortcuts can directly load your favorite online apps.\n\nDynamic tabs\n\nYou can drag tabs out of the browser to create new windows, gather multiple tabs into one window or arrange your tabs however you wish -- quickly and easily.\n\nCrash control\n\nEvery tab you're using is run independently in the browser, so if one app crashes it won't take anything else down.\n\nIncognito mode\n\nDon't want pages you visit to show up in your web history?\nChoose incognito mode for private browsing.\n\nSafe browsing\n\nGoogle Chrome warns you if you're about to visit a suspected phishing, malware or otherwise unsafe website.\n\nInstant bookmarks\n\nWant to bookmark a web page? Just click the star icon at the left edge of the address bar and you're done.\n\nImporting settings\n\nWhen you switch to Google Chrome, you can pick up where you left off with all the bookmarks and passwords from your existing browser.\n\nSimpler downloads\n\nNo intrusive download manager; you see your download's status at the bottom of your current window.\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nHere you can read about the technology: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0c97da4ff211d18ad05e5e821d636814ef02de","amp;dn":"Google+Chrome+%28Chromium%29+1.0.154.59","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0c97da4ff211d18ad05e5e821d636814ef02de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,12,151,218,79,242,17,209,138,208,94,94,130,29,99,104,20,239,2,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's a love story, but that fails to describe such a bizarre turn of events. Anderson's only comedy (as of the date this is written, obviously) is tender and mystical, \na mosaic of spakling color and romance that is more relatable than any packaged date movie. \nThis will never be remembered like Boogie Nights or There Will Be Blood, but it cannot be denied its place as an astonishing work in its own right.\n-----------------\n\n\nRegion 1 (NTSC) DVD9\nRipped with no compression using DVDShrink 3.2\nFrench Audio Stripped; dubbing is a sin\nBonus Materials on Disc 2 (Go Buy It)\n\nSubs: English, French\n\nMotion Picture Rating (MPAA): Rated R\nRuntime: 95 min\nAudio: AC3 5.1 Surround, DTS 5.1, 2-Ch Commentary\nAspect Ratio:  2.35:1\nRelease Date:  1 November 2002 (USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e3df0cf85c9edd779c5e0503d9516be5344b24a","amp;dn":"Punch-Drunk+Love+%282002%29+P.+T.+Anderson+%5BNTSC-DVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e3df0cf85c9edd779c5e0503d9516be5344b24a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,61,240,207,133,201,237,215,121,197,224,80,61,149,22,190,83,68,178,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

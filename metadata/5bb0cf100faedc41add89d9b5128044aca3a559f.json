A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 7: The Citadel\n\nDuring the spring stalemate, all eyes turn to Kursk. Soviet war production, now moved out of the reach of German bombers, increases dramatically. The Germans prepare to meet the Red Army on the plains of Kursk. This is the greatest tank battle in the history of warfare.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb0cf100faedc41add89d9b5128044aca3a559f","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+7%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb0cf100faedc41add89d9b5128044aca3a559f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,176,207,16,15,174,220,65,173,216,157,155,81,40,4,74,202,58,85,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Idol is too big (XviD is 700MB) and by that unsuitable for many people... especially for guy from Africa who requested AI two weeks back and I turned them down. As I've said back then, my &quot;as usual&quot; 720p re-encodes of AI and other live shows always turns bad. Hence, this is XviD re-encode for the people willing to take trade-offs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087b329e048c4227c0507e01b064af784a6910cf","amp;dn":"American.Idol.S09E13.Top.12.Girls.Perform.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087b329e048c4227c0507e01b064af784a6910cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,123,50,158,4,140,66,39,192,80,126,1,176,100,175,120,74,105,16,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

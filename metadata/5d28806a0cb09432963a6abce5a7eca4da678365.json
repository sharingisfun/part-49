Think Forth Road Bridge and Forth Railway Bridge.   Anyway... early one evening just near Dalmeny railway station one of my neighbours car got splattered on a level crossing without gate or barrier.   Police found the number plate in the wreckage but no body.   They went to break the news to his wife.   She told them they were bonkers and invited them in.   There he was...tray on his knee, eating his supper, and not a scratch on him.   He'd picked himself up and walked away from the scene.\n   A fortnight later the same guy, drunk out of his skull, gets hit by a car.   walks away without a scratch.   \n\nWeird or what.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d28806a0cb09432963a6abce5a7eca4da678365","amp;dn":"Cliff+Richard+-+1982+-+Now+You+See+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d28806a0cb09432963a6abce5a7eca4da678365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,40,128,106,12,176,148,50,150,58,106,188,229,167,236,164,218,103,131,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

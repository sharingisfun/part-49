Every episode was fact based and the realism of the show was elevated by the use of actual combat footage from the files of the United States Navy.\n\nThe stories, which varied between the South Pacific during World War II, the Atlantic campaign and the Korean War, were the brainchild of Rear Admiral Thomas M. Dykers, himself a submariner, who retired from the Navy in 1949 after 22 years of service. Admiral Dykers also did an intro piece for each episode, narrated the action and filmed a closing segment, usually with a member of the crew of the submarine that was highlighted on that particular episode.\n\nEach season was comprised of 39 episodes. All of the episodes for season one are complete, however there are three missing episodes for season two. If anyone has copies or knows where they are available, please let me know.\n\nIn addition to the episodes, I've included copies of the press kits that were issued to the stations along with the films. I've also included episode summaries which are handy in preparing notices / programs for individual viewing.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nSeries One\n\nS01E01 - USS Jack 'The Jack at Tokyo'\nS01E02 - USS Trout 'The Trout at Rainbow's End'\nS01E03 - USS Thresher 'The End of the Line'\nS01E04 - USS Sculpin 'The Sculpin Story'\nS01E05 - USS Spearfish 'The Spearfish Delivers'\nS01E06 - USS Bergall 'The Bergall's Dilemma'\nS01E07 - USS Batfish 'The Batfish Scores'\nS01E08 - USS Tigrone 'Tigrone Sets a Record'\nS01E09 - USS Gato 'Five Ring Circus'\nS01E10 - USS Pampanito 'The Pampanito Story'\nS01E11 - USS Tirante 'Tirante Plays a Hunch'\nS01E12 - USS Tang 'Tang vs. Truk'\nS01E13 - USS Wahoo 'Wahoo's Final Report'\nS01E14 - USS Dace, USS Darter 'Two Davids and Goliath'\nS01E15 - USS S-38 'The Ordeal of the S-38'\nS01E16 - USS Seahorse 'The Seahorse Story'\nS01E17 - USS Salmon 'The Salmon Swims Upstream'\nS01E18 - USS Crevalle 'Cargo for Crevalle'\nS01E19 - USS Crevalle 'Boomerang'\nS01E20 - USS Sailfish 'The Squailfish'\nS01E21 - USS Grouper 'The Grouper Story'\nS01E22 - USS Seawolf 'The Eyes of the Seawolf'\nS01E23 - USS Seadragon 'The Seadragon Story'\nS01E24 - USS Narwhal 'Narwhal's Passenger From Mindanao'\nS01E25 - USS Perch 'The Perch's New Role'\nS01E26 - USS Barb 'The Final War Patrol'\nS01E27 - USS Cochino 'The Last Dive'\nS01E28 - USS Gar 'The Gar Story'\nS01E29 - USS Flier 'The Flier Story'\nS01E30 - USS Starfish 'The Starfish Came Home'\nS01E31 - USS Sealion 'The Sealion Story'\nS01E32 - USS Nautilus 'The Nautilus Story'\nS01E33 - USS Harder 'Hit 'Em Again, Harder'\nS01E34 - USS Seashark 'The Seashark Story'\nS01E35 - Mines (9 Sub Wolfpack) 'The Tshushima Straits Story'\nS01E36 - USS Searaven 'The Searaven Story'\nS01E37 - USS Tang 'The Loss of the Tang'\nS01E38 - USS Perch 'The Loss of the Perch'\nS01E39 - USS Guardfish 'The Guardfish Story'\nSilent Service Press Kit - Series I (PDF File)\nSilent Service Executive Summary - Series I (PDF File)\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nSeries Two\n\nS02E01 - USS Archerfish 'The Archerfish Spits Straight'\nS02E02 - USS Sea Devil 'The Sea Devil Attacks Puget Sound'\nS02E03 - USS Bergall 'The Bergall's Revenge'\nS02E04 - USS S-34 'The Unsuccessful Patrol'\nS02E05 - USS Aspro 'The Aspro Story'\nS02E06 - USS Thresher 'The Thresher Story'\nS02E07 - USS Nautilus 'The Ugly Duckling' Ã¢â€Â¬ÃƒÂ¡(not available)\nS02E08 - USS Peto 'Peto Plucks Some Chickens'\nS02E09 - USS S-38 'The S-38 Story'\nS02E10 - USS Tarpon 'Incident Down South'\nS02E11 - USS Trigger 'Mine, for Keeps'\nS02E12 - USS Baya 'Fish Out of Water'\nS02E13 - USS Cod 'Cod's Lost Boarding Party'\nS02E14 - USS Triton 'The Triton's Christmas'\nS02E15 - USS Hawkbill 'The Hawkbill's Revenge'\nS02E16 - Tigershark 'The Tigershark'\nS02E17 - USS Cavalla 'The Cavalla Story'\nS02E18 - USS Growler 'The Growler's Captain'\nS02E19 - USS Tinosa 'TheUSS Tinosa Story'\nS02E20 - USS Grayling 'The Grayling Story'\nS02E21 - USS S-44 'The S-44 Story' Ã¢â€Â¬ÃƒÂ¡(not available)\nS02E22 - USS Pargo 'The Pargo's Lucky Seventh'\nS02E23 - USS Crevalle 'Crevalle's Mine Plant'\nS02E24 - USS Sunfish 'The Sunfish Story'\nS02E25 - USS Sunfish 'The Sunfish's Cook'\nS02E26 - USS Nautilus 'Nautilus and the Nuns'\nS02E27 - Sandshark 'The Sandshark Story'\nS02E28 - USS Seadragon 'Operation Seadragon'\nS02E29 - USS Harder 'Harder at Woleai'\nS02E30 - USS Tautog 'The Tautog Story'\nS02E31 - USS Swordfish 'The Swordfish Story'\nS02E32 - USS Gabilan 'The Gabilan Story'\nS02E33 - USS Gato 'The Gato Story'\nS02E34 - USS Silversides 'The Silversides Story'\nS02E35 - USS Bowfin 'The Bowfin Story'\nS02E36 - HMS Cobra 'Royal Submarines' Ã¢â€Â¬ÃƒÂ¡Ã¢â€Â¬ÃƒÂ¡(not available)\nS02E37 - USS Squalus 'The Squalus Story'\nS02E38 - Seanettle 'Seanettle Vs.

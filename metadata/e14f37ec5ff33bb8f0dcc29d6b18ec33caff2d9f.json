When You Get Lonesome\n\n\nDocument Records have only the one David &quot;Honey Boy&quot; Edwards CD available, but what a CD it is. Recorded in 1975 and originally released on vinyl (Roots SL-518), the sound restoration is excellent as is the quality of Mississippi Delta Blues being played. Although the CD is NOT LIVE, the selection on Blues, Blues does play like a micro potted biography of Honey Boy's life, with numbers by his friends Tommy McClennan and Chester &quot;Howlin'&quot; Wolf Burnett. From the personal Blue, Blues with it's sympathetic and &quot;lonesome&quot; harmonica accompaniment, to the Chicago blues fanfare by Robert Johnson; Sweet Home Chicago. His experiences as an itinerant musician is summed up in Big Bill Broonzy's Key To The Highway. Tales of betrayal and wrongdoing in love are told in Drop Down Mama with it's delicate slide guitar accompaniment. Images of the heat drenched Mississippi juke joints are conjured up as Honey Boy skips and bounces his way through I Love You Baby. The kind of hurt and loneliness only known by the experience of lost love is powerfully portrayed in When You Get Lonesome.\n\nThe Mississippi Delta country blues, and the way of life that Honey Boy experienced are brought to life by this true Afro-American artist. Honey Boy's rich and seasoned vocals set against his acoustic guitar, including some fine bottleneck slide guitar and wonderful rack-harmonica goes to the heart of the blues: &quot;the Blues, Blues&quot;. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14f37ec5ff33bb8f0dcc29d6b18ec33caff2d9f","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Honeyboy+Edwards+-+Blues%2C+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14f37ec5ff33bb8f0dcc29d6b18ec33caff2d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,79,55,236,95,243,59,184,240,220,194,157,107,24,236,51,202,255,45,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.\n\nRated PG-13 for thematic elements, violence and disturbing content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c290ba03bcd299cd5d4af18c3f02b6455aa38a","amp;dn":"Season+Of+The+Witch+DVDRip+XVID+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c290ba03bcd299cd5d4af18c3f02b6455aa38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,194,144,186,3,188,210,153,205,93,74,241,140,63,2,182,69,90,163,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

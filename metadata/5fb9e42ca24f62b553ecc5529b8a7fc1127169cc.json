But when he takes revenge upon a former employer who betrayed him, he exposes himself to something heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never had to face before.\n\nA killer who is just like him.\n\nCode-named Dead Eye, Russell Whitlock is a graduate of the same ultra-secret Autonomous Asset Program that trained and once controlled Gentry. But now, Whitlock is a free agent who has been directed to terminate his fellow student of death. He knows how his target thinks, how he moves, and how he kills. And he knows the best way to do the job is to make Gentry run for his life - right up until the moment Dead Eye finally ends it...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Bourne for the new millennium.&quot;\n--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Eye of God\n\n&quot;Hard, fast, and unflinching--exactly what a thriller should be.&quot;\n--Lee Child\n\n&quot;Writing as smooth as stainless steel and a hero as mean as razor wire...&quot;\n--David Stone\n\n&quot;In this third installment of the Gray Man series the story is so propulsive, the murders so explosive, that flipping the pages feels like playing the ultimate video game.&quot;\n--New York Times\n\n&quot;Greaney once again pumps new life into familiar thriller conventions.&quot;\n--Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;The ending screamsfor a sequel, but it will be difficult to maintain the intensity level of this impressive debut.&quot;\n--Booklist\n\n&quot;A high-octane thriller that doesn't pause for more than a second.&quot;\n--Chicago Sun-Times\n\n&quot;Take fictional spy Jason Bourne, pump him up with Red Bull and meth, shake vigorously--and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the recipe for Court Gentry.&quot;\n--The Memphis Commercial Appeal\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMark Greaney is the #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Threat Vector, by Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney, as well as Command Authority and Locked On, also by Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney.

On April 12, 2009, the song debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, giving Calvin his first solo #1 single in the UK and second overall.\n\nThe video for &quot;I'm Not Alone&quot; was filmed in Oslo, Norway on February 6 2009 and directed by Christian Holm-Glad. Later, it had to be re-edited to remove footage showing Harris holding an antique knife in order to be shown on television channels.[1] The beginning of the music video sees a small boy (possibly meant to represent a young Harris) in the woods with a teddy bear. However the boy suddenly drops the teddy bear and loses it. The rest of music video sees Harris in a dungeon-style setting performing Frankenstein-type experiments on numerous female captors, combining their parts to make a new teddy bear.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nVideo\n-----\nRipped from the official music video 'Calvin Harris - I'm Not Alone'...\n\n\nVideo Format     - mpeg4\nVideo Quality    - ~1400kbps\nVideo Resolution - 480 x 268\nFrame Rate       - 25 fps\n   \nSound Quality    - 160kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\n\nAudio\n-----\nRipped from the official music video 'Calvin Harris - I'm Not Alone'...\n\n\nSound Quality    - 192kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\n\nSeed, enjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0eed3d8c16abd29b12740ca72f663387d95a18","amp;dn":"Calvin+Harris+-+I%5C%27m+Not+Alone+%28Music+Vid+%26+Audio%29+%7BGOLDFiSH%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0eed3d8c16abd29b12740ca72f663387d95a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,14,237,61,140,22,171,210,155,18,116,12,167,47,102,51,135,217,90,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

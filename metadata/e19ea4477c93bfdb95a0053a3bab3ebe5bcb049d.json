There was one Featured track (see my torrents), one extended mix (see 'em again) and four other notable tracks.  All these were sourced from my own personal vinyl/CD collection.\n\nThe site was pretty popular and I was contacted by many people across the world.  Unfortunately, he BPI decided I was being a naughty boy and my site closed.\n\nI archived all the tracks I posted furing those three and a half years and already posted the Featured and Extended Mixes on here.  This is volume 28 of 30 (each should fit on an 80 minute CDR) of rare, and some not so, 80's music.\n\nThese tracks are encoded at 128K as in &quot;those days&quot; the majority of visitors to Rare 80's MP3 were on dial-up (as I was until summer 2002).\n\nHappy listening!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e19ea4477c93bfdb95a0053a3bab3ebe5bcb049d","amp;dn":"Rare+80%5C%27s+MP3+-+Volume+28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e19ea4477c93bfdb95a0053a3bab3ebe5bcb049d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,158,164,71,124,147,191,219,149,160,5,58,59,171,62,190,91,203,4,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

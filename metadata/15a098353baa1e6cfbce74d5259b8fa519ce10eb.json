Watchmen: The End is Nigh will go beyond the film and delve into the characters,\nrivalries and challenges in a mature action-brawler. The game features bloody, visceral combat in rich\nsettings while it explores the crime-fighting partnership of urban vigilantes Rorschach and Nite Owl.\n\nCategory: PC\nLanguage: English,French,Italian,Spain,German\nType    : Action\nQuality : DVD\nFormat  : ISO\nSize    : 1.54 GB\nR.Date  : 14-03-2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a098353baa1e6cfbce74d5259b8fa519ce10eb","amp;dn":"Watchmen+The+End+Is+Nigh+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPCDVD%5D%5BAction+PC+Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15a098353baa1e6cfbce74d5259b8fa519ce10eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,160,152,53,59,170,30,108,251,206,116,213,37,155,143,165,25,206,16,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

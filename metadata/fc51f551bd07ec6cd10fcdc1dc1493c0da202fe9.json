Sun, sand, and sea are not things that appear on his top ten list. The case is supposedly just a simple divorce, but as soon as Michael Helge sets feet on French soil, everything goes wrong. He gets hustled for 10 million kroner of the company's money, and suddenly the future looks less bright. Fortunately, he meets his old friend, the frivolous gambler Theo, and together they plan how to get all the money back in a true James Bond style... \n\n.:Cast Info:. \nDitte Arnth \t\t... \tSille\nRasmus Bjerg \t\t... \tMichael-Helge\nClÃƒÂ©ment Brun \t\t... \tThe Airport Man\nLars Brygmann \t\t... \tBob\nCasper Christensen \t... \tTheo\nEllen HillingsÃƒÂ¸ \t... \tMarianne\nLise Koefoed \t\t... \tLouise \n\n.:General Info:. \nFormat: Matroska\nFile Size: 337  MiB\nOverall Bitrate: 595 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 19mn\nSample: Included\nSubTitles: Danish | Finnish | Norwegian | Swedish | English (Muxed)\n\n.:Video Info:.\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nResolution: 688 x 288 pixels\nSource: Player 720p BluRay x264-CONDITION, Thanks! \n\n.:Audio Info:. \nAudio language: Danish\nAudio Codec: AAC\nChannel Count: 2 channels (L R)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nXtra info:\nTim Robbins was considered for the role of Chief Porter.\n\n\nSpeciella hÃƒÂ¤lsningar till:\nVajnis, Mr_Keff &amp; Mr.Stifmeister\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSEEDA EFTER DIG SOM TACK..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc51f551bd07ec6cd10fcdc1dc1493c0da202fe9","amp;dn":"Player.2013.ENG.NORDiC.BRRip.x264.AAC-Devil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc51f551bd07ec6cd10fcdc1dc1493c0da202fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,81,245,81,189,7,236,108,209,15,205,193,220,20,147,192,218,32,47,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

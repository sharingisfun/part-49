Players begin &quot;Grand Slam Career&quot; mode by creating and customizing a character, then traveling to Australia, France, Wimbledon, and New York to take on some of history's greatest tennis stars, including Roger Federer, Pete Sampras, Serena Williams, Bjorn Borg, and John McEnroe. Wii MotionPlus is fully integrated into the game, and gamers must learn to master each real-life stroke in order to conquer a variety of challenges and boost their character's skills. Those looking for human competition can head online to play with created characters or any of the 23 included stars, or they can join friends for a dozen different mini-games in &quot;Tennis Party&quot; mode. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ccdb1d63ca1db1d242dae50735b812faef210ef","amp;dn":"%5BWII%5D+Grand+Slam+Tennis+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ccdb1d63ca1db1d242dae50735b812faef210ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,205,177,214,60,161,219,29,36,45,174,80,115,91,129,47,174,242,16,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

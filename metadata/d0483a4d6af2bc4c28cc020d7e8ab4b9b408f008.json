This is a unique story of a teenage part-time prostitute who spends her earnings buying ice cream for neighborhood children, and of the man who obsesses over her from afar, told from both angles, and spanning their lives. However, the approach of this story intends to transcend taboos and judgment to offer the listener a vast spectrum of the emotion and ideals of the characters, setting and circumstance. This album was written with the dream that it might one day be sung by Dolly Parton, and so pays tribute to her work and inspiration...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0483a4d6af2bc4c28cc020d7e8ab4b9b408f008","amp;dn":"Viking+Moses+-+The+Parts+that+Showed+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0483a4d6af2bc4c28cc020d7e8ab4b9b408f008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,72,58,77,106,242,188,76,40,204,2,13,126,138,180,185,180,8,240,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But little research has been completed on the study of the Mexican military. Camp provides in this work fresh empirical data for testing claims concerning civilian-military relations, and succeeds in his comprehensive analysis despite the military's intense desire to remain unexamined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfedbdf73994c21c27f129aa623f67131b7ca99a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1992%5D+Generals+in+the+Palacio+The+Military+in+Modern+Mexi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfedbdf73994c21c27f129aa623f67131b7ca99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,237,189,247,57,148,194,28,39,241,41,170,98,63,103,19,27,124,169,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

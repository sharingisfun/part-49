It seems that somehow the patch lost execute privileges on upload. I have re-uploaded the torrent, a working version can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4618953&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4618953&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor those who have already downloaded this torrent, see the instructions from the other torrent that should fix the patch:\n\n'Navigate to &quot;/Path Finder [P]atch.app/Contents/MacOS&quot; and apply execute privileges to the &quot;iPatcher&quot; binary. Anybody experienced in computers should know how to do this. For those who don't, all it takes is a &quot;chmod a+x [path to iPatcher file]&quot; in Terminal.'\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nA great alternative to Finder.app, it has a similar look and many more features. Includes version 5.0.5 of the app, as well as a crack courtesy of [K]ambing.\n\nSeed at least 2x! The files are small, so it won't take very much bandwidth.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAs espirates pointed out, this is compatible with Mac OS 10.5 Leopard ONLY.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.cocoatech.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.cocoatech.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSize:  21.7 MB\n\nFormats:  app, dmg, txt\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNote:\n\nIf &quot;[K]ambing&quot; would like me to take this down, just ask.\n\nAlso, in the instructions, &quot;path&quot; should be &quot;patch&quot;.

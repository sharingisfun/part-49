The band comprised David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison. Auxiliary musicians also frequently made appearances in concert and on the group's albums.\n\nThe new wave musical style of Talking Heads combined elements of punk rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music and art rock. Frontman and songwriter David Byrne contributed whimsical, esoteric lyrics to the band's songs, and emphasized their showmanship through various multimedia projects and performances. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Talking Heads as being &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s, while managing to earn several pop hits.&quot;\n\nIn 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Three of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the Channel 4 100 Greatest Albums poll listed one album (Fear of Music) at number 76. Their concert film Stop Making Sense is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of the genre.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b816843d585f60dc8240094a0fca2cda2104117","amp;dn":"Talking+Heads+-+Live+in+Ontario+%281980+Heatwave+Festival%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b816843d585f60dc8240094a0fca2cda2104117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,129,104,67,213,133,246,13,200,36,0,148,160,252,162,205,162,16,65,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

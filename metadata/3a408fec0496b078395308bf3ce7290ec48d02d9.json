He born 1984 in Waymar (Germany). Starting out as a DJ when he was 19 he has an eclectic background in music.. from HOUSE, BREAKz, BREAK-BEAT, and MELODIK TRANCE tracks that he loves to play today. He spent quite a few years of the decks and in the studio engineering, producing and remixing for all sorts of weird and wonderful people. The music was FREESTYLE there was a lot of feeling in it, and it was very hard to let that go. But later about 2001, the scene turned into BREAK-BEAT and so did he. In 2003 BREAKz music started hitting the clubs in Odessa, and he changed his style. \n\nSTYLE- His style varies but stays in the same venue. His main sets are ELECTRO, HOUSE, BREAKz, BREAK-BEAT, and MELODIK TRANCE. He would like to be known as an original. He likes to make sets that are unique and solely to himself. He mixes things up and changes the sound of the original music, (by eq or flange, etc.), so that it sounds like something new and not one record to another. He also tries to get involved with the crowd when possible, to show them that he&amp;#039;s not just sitting back and playing record to record. Every time he spins, he gives it 100%... \n\nINFLUENCES- Plump DJ, DJ Spartaque, Dj Fixx, Huda Hudia, Infiniti, Santana, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Arman Van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, Tiesto, Space Brothers, Matt Darey, Dave Conaltie, George Acosta, Kimble Collins, RABBIT IN THE MOON, BT, SUNDAY CLUB, and his friends Noel W.

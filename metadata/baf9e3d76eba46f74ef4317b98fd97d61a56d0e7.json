Yet true art seems to take its purest form when forged through turmoil, and this much-anticipated release is as pure as solid gold. The 12 tracks featured here are nothing short of a brilliant pop tapestry woven through Leigh Nash's airy and vibrant vocals and songwriter Matt Slocum's finely textured guitar work. While fans of &quot;Kiss Me&quot; will relate to the upbeat &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Breathe Your Name,&quot; no one should mistake the upbeat pop for shallowness. In fact, tracks like &quot;Down and Out of Time,&quot; &quot;Paralyzed,&quot; and &quot;I've Been Waiting&quot; display a rich lyrical depth centered on the human experience. Throughout Divine, Slocum showcases a prowess for offsetting Nash's lilting melodies against haunting, minor key choruses, creating a bittersweet melancholy that lingers well after each song. Perhaps the band does this no better than in the ending track, &quot;A Million Parachutes,&quot; which captures that dull ache of longing for friends from afar. It's a feeling well known to those Sixpence fans who have waited five long years for this release. The wait was well worth it. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf9e3d76eba46f74ef4317b98fd97d61a56d0e7","amp;dn":"Sixpence+None+The+Richer+-+2002+-+Divine+Discontent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf9e3d76eba46f74ef4317b98fd97d61a56d0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,249,227,215,110,186,70,247,78,244,49,123,152,253,151,214,26,86,208,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

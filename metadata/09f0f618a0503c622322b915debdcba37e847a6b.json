But the swamps hold dangers of their own, not the least of which are flesh-eating alligators lurking in the shadows. Mari Aldon and Richard Webb also star in this unconventional Western set during the Seminole Indian Rebellion of 1840.\n\n\nAs usual, this folder contains no Virus, no Password, and no Popups.

Return to Mysterious Island 2,  the  sequel  to  adventure      ??\n ??      game Return to Mysterious Island  released  in  2005,  and      ??\n ??      inspired from Jules Verne's novel The  Mysterious  Island,      ??\n ??      offers the player an  experience  comparable  to  that  of      ??\n ??      Robinson Crusoe or one of Verne's characters. But in  this      ??\n ??      new installment, survival is not all! The player will also      ??\n ??      have to save the island from  an  environmental  disaster.      ??\n ??      The scenario enhances ecological issues that were  already      ??\n ??      shared by Jules Verne  and  that  no  one  ever  questions      ?? \n ??      today. Return to Mysterious Island 2 begins with the crash      ??  \n ??      of the helicopter that came to rescue Mina.  She  survived      ??  \n ??      but is once again trapped on the island. All of a  sudden,      ??  \n ??      under her very  eyes,  an  unknown  disease  afflicts  the      ??  \n ??      plants first, then the  animal  life.  Mina  explores  the      ??  \n ??      island  to  locate  the  infection  source.  She  searches      ??  \n ??      Captain Nemo's base in vain, then the ruins of an  unknown      ??  \n ??      civilization, and finally understands that it  is  outside      ??  \n ??      pollution that threatens the island. The only way to  save      ??  \n ??      this natural wonder is to turn the shield back on. But  if      ??  \n ??      Mina makes this decision, she gives up  -as  Captain  Nemo      ??  \n ??      did before her- the idea of returning to civilization..         ??\n ??                                                                      ??\n ??                                                                      ??\n ??                                                                      ??\n ???????                                                            ??\n ????????                                                          ??\n?????????                                                         ??\n?????????                                                         ??\n ???????                                                            ??\n ???   ?  ????

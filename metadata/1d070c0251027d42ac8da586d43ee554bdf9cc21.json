A new sovereign can revive a royal family or be its kiss of death. So will the controversial successor to Queen Elizabeth II spell the end of Britain's thousand-year monarchy? This film looks at the shaky future of the House of Windsor, once the beloved Queen passes the crown to her son Charles. \n\nThe aging and opinionated Prince of Wales is not widely loved in Britain or abroad. The public still resents his treatment of Lady Diana, his adulterous relationship with Camilla, now destined to be Queen, and his relentless meddling in politics. &quot;An overtly political king,&quot; says respected British columnist Johann Hari, &quot;will be death for the monarchy.&quot;\n\nMany agree and look to Charles' older son Prince William. But &quot;Wills&quot; is a reluctant Royal, still haunted by the brutal death of his glamorous mother Diana. His brother, Prince Harry, is best known for an unflattering series of public scandals.This documentary chronicles the storm gathering over the House of Windsor, and asks the once unthinkable question: Will the monarchy still be around after Elizabeth? After Elizabeth II is written &amp; directed by Gemini Award winning filmmaker John Curtin.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 7s 514ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 963 Kbps\nAspect            : 576 x 336 (1.714) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 130 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d070c0251027d42ac8da586d43ee554bdf9cc21","amp;dn":"CBC+Doc+Zone-After+Elizabeth+II+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d070c0251027d42ac8da586d43ee554bdf9cc21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,7,12,2,81,2,125,66,172,141,165,134,212,62,229,84,189,249,204,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

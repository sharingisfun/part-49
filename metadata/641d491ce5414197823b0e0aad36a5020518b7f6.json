Huntington and Warren Demian Manshel.\n\nOriginally, the magazine was a quarterly in a notable, unusual physical format Ã¢â‚¬â€œ printed in a narrow 4&quot; Ãƒâ€” 11&quot; size.\nUnder editor-in-chief MoisÃƒÂ©s NaÃƒÂ­m (1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010), Foreign Policy changed from an academic quarterly in the 1990s to a bimonthly glossy, winning the 2003, 2007, and 2009 National Magazine Awards for General Excellence. The topics covered by the magazine include global politics, economics, integration and ideas. On September 29, 2008, The Washington Post Company announced that they had purchased Foreign Policy from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nContributors for Foreign Policy include former US diplomat Peter Galbraith, Pulitzer Prize-winning military reporter Tom Ricks, international bestseller Stephen Walt, blogger Daniel Drezner, former Los Angeles Times columnist Rosa Brooks, Condoleezza Rice's longtime chief speechwriter Christian Brose, 9/11 Commission director Philip Zelikow, ex-senior White House aide Peter Feaver, top Pentagon official Dov Zakheim, John McCain's foreign policy adviser Steve Biegun, and Washington journalist Josh Rogin (who specializes in investigative reports on national security and foreign policy).\nForeign Policy publishes the annual Globalization Index, and Failed State Index. Its report, Inside the Ivory Tower, provides an annual comprehensive ranking of professional schools in international relations. The magazine has a Think Again section where it publishes pieces explaining/debunking (current) foreign policy misconceptions.\n\nA Spanish edition of Foreign Policy, named Foreign Policy en espaÃƒÂ±ol is published by FundaciÃƒÂ³n para las Relaciones Internacionales y el DiÃƒÂ¡logo Exterior (FRIDE) since 2004.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.foreignpolicy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.foreignpolicy.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.foreignpolicy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.foreignpolicy.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641d491ce5414197823b0e0aad36a5020518b7f6","amp;dn":"Foreign_Policy_2013-11-12.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641d491ce5414197823b0e0aad36a5020518b7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,29,73,28,229,65,65,151,130,59,14,10,173,54,165,2,5,24,183,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

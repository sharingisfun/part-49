Boog wakes him as the two scream in terror. With Boog reluctant to intervene, Elliot begs to Boog for help to escape.

But during a mishap, Elliot's new antlers are cracked off and now look like they did in the first film, which upsets him. Luckily, Boog (Mike Epps) and the others manage to cheer Elliot up by having a rabbit fight. But Elliot has new emotions about his marriage and feels reluctant to marry Giselle. Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron) finds a dog biscuit trail that his previous owners left behind and uncontrollably follows it. At the climax of the wedding, Elliot witnesses Mr. Weenie being taking away by his old owners, Bob and Bobbie (Georgia Engel). Elliot tells the story to the other forest animals (a little overreacting) and decide to make a rescue mission to save him. The other ones that go on Elliot's rescue mission are Boog, Giselle, McSquizzy (Billy Connolly), Buddy, (Matthew W. Taylor), and Serge (Danny Mann) and Deni (Matthew W. Taylor).\n\n::General::\n\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 892.31 MiB\nDuration: 1h 16mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 633 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-18 03:16:22\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1107365/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1107365/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Animation | Adventure | Comedy\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nScreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87317301053644633865.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87317301053644633865.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/82094381323789396722.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/82094381323789396722.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOpen Season 3\n\nStoryline: In the beginning of spring, Boog (Mike Epps) plans an annual guys trip to spend time with his male friends, but Reilly (Jon Favreau) is busy with the beaver dam, McSquizzy (Billy Connolly) is looking after the Furry Tail Clan (Carlos Alazraqui), Ian (Matthew W.

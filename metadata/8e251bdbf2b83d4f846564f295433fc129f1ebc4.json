Geelong, coming off a 3 point win last Friday night against reigning premiers Collingwood, faced another big game against reigning Browlow Medalist Chris Judd's Carlton who had the bye last week. Geelong's new coach Chris Scott has a perfect 7-0 start to his AFL coaching career and is up against Carlton's coach Brett Ratten, who is looking to win a finals game for a pass mark this year, and whose stocks would rise with a win against Geelong and would put the rest of the competition on notice. Could this game rival last weeks Cats v Magpies clash? Would that be too much to ask? Watch and find out.\n\n\nCurrent Ladder Positions After Round 08\n---------------------------------------\n                  Pos P  W  D  L  For Agn Pts %\nGeelong Cats      1st 7  7  0  0  649 443 28  146.50\nCarlton Blues     4th 5  1  1  1  684 548 22  124.82\n\n\nTeams\n-----\nCarlton\n\nB: Bret Thornton, Michael Jamison, Nick Duigan\nHB: Andrew Carrazzo, Jordan Russell, Christopher Yarran\nC: Bryce Gibbs, David Ellard, Jeremy Laidler\nHF: Eddie Betts, Jarrad Waite, Jeffrey Garlett\nF: Setanta O'hAilpin, Andrew Walker, Kade Simpson\nFoll: Robert Warnock, Chris Judd, Marc Murphy\nI/C: Heath Scotland, Dennis Armfield, Brock McLean\nSub: Mitch Robinson\n\nIn: Brock McLean, Jeremy Laidler\nOut: Aaron Joseph, Edward Curnow (Shoulder)\n\nMilestones: Dennis Armfield - 50 games\n\n\nGeelong Cats\n\nB: Josh Hunt, Harry Taylor, Darren Milburn\nHB: Corey Enright, Matthew Scarlett, Taylor Hunt\nC: Jimmy Bartel, Joel Corey, Andrew Mackie\nHF: Steve Johnson, Joel Selwood, Mathew Stokes\nF: Paul Chapman, James Podsiadly, Nathan Vardy\nFoll: Brad Ottens, Allen Christensen, James Kelly\nI/C: Tom Hawkins, Travis Varcoe, Mitch Duncan\nSub: David Wojcinski\n\nIn: Darren Milburn, Taylor Hunt, Nathan Vardy\nOut: Cameron Ling (Shoulder), Tom Lonergan (Calf), Daniel Menzel (Shins) \nNew: Nathan Vardy (Gippsland U18)\n\n\nUmpires: C.Donlon, M.Vozzo, J.Armstrong, H.Ryan\nBoundary: M.Lefevre, J.Bennison, A.Coote, J.Morris\nGoal: P.Nastasi, A.Wojcik, M.Canning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e251bdbf2b83d4f846564f295433fc129f1ebc4","amp;dn":"AFL.2011.R09.Carlton.v.Geelong.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e251bdbf2b83d4f846564f295433fc129f1ebc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,37,27,219,242,184,61,79,132,101,100,242,149,67,63,193,41,241,235,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

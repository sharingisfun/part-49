When Lateef is given heavier tasks to compensate for new Afghan worker Rahmat, he resents his displacement and treats Rahmat cruelly. After one of his pranks, however, Lateef discovers Rahmat&amp;#039;s secret--he is a girl named Baran. Latif&amp;#039;s heart softens towards Baran and he shows his new affection for her by doing what he can to ease the hardships she suffers at work. When government inspectors force all Afghans to be fired from the site, Lateef discovers he cannot bear to be without her. Jeopardizing social standing and endangering his own well being, Lateef stops at nothing to save his love.\n\nSystem: NTSC\n\nSpoken Language: Iranian\n\nRatio Relation: 3:2\n\nAudio: 2.0 Stereo\n\nSoftware Used: DVD Shrink","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f6313a12f7f6cdb7de6527ec972bc76606fd901","amp;dn":"Baran+-+NTSC+-+Spanish-English+Subtitles+%28Full+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f6313a12f7f6cdb7de6527ec972bc76606fd901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,99,19,161,47,127,108,219,125,230,82,126,201,114,188,118,96,111,217,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

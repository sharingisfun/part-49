Many are facing a hard choice: Paying for gas or paying the mortgage. How did it come to this? It&amp;#039;s not just about America&amp;#039;s financial crisis; it&amp;#039;s also about big problems with our national infrastructure. Overstressed highways and too few public transportation options are wreaking havoc on people&amp;#039;s lives and hitting the brakes on our already-stretched economy.\n\nThis week, NOW on PBS takes a close-up look at our inadequate transportation network and visits some people paying a high priceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in both dollars and quality of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just to get to work. Do we have the means to modernize both our infrastructure and our lifestyles?\n\nThis is the first installment in &quot;Blueprint America,&quot; a year-long, PBS-wide series focusing on the nation&amp;#039;s infrastructure. &quot;Blueprint America&quot; is an initiative of Thirteen/WNET.\n\nMore Info: http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/440/index.html\n\n==============================================================\nName.............: Now.20081010.BluePrintAmerica.DrivenToDespair.xvid.avi\nFilesize..........: 349 MB (or 357,550 KB or 366,131,200 bytes)\nRuntime.........: 00:25:31 (45,872 fr)\nVideo Codec...: XviD\nVideo Bitrate...: 1739 kb/s\nFPS...............: 29.970\nAudio Codec...: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate...: 165 kb/s (82/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size.....: 640x368 (1.74:1) [=40:23]\nFrame Quality..: 0.246 bits/pixel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99cb0d2ac34b68d3218654327b5831496b72e32","amp;dn":"PBS+Now+-+20081010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99cb0d2ac34b68d3218654327b5831496b72e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,156,176,210,172,52,182,141,50,24,101,67,39,181,131,20,150,183,46,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

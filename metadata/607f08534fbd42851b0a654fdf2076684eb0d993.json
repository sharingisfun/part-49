Even if a hard drive works flawlessly, it should still\nbe regularly checked and maintained. This way an imminent hard\ndrive failure can be detected early and might be prevented. If\nsuddenly major problems occur or if your hard drive even\ncompletely fails, data loss might be the result.\n\nMake sure you are prepared for such a situation. Ashampoo HDD\nControl 2 can notify you early so that your valuable data wont\nbecome the victim of a hardware crash.\n\nNow Ashampoo HDD Control 2 offers even more functions to check\nthe status of your hard drive(s).\n\nUse for example the S.M.A.R.T self-test or adjust the noise level\nand power management of your hard drive(s) (if supported).\nFurthermore you can restore accidentally deleted files and\nfolders with Ashampoo HDD Control 2.\n\nGet to know the all-rounder for monitoring, maintenance and\ndefragmentation, and check the health status and performance of\nyour hard drive(s) today.\n\nSoftware Highlights:\nConstant monitoring of your hard drive(s) (also for multi-user\nsystems)\nExtended user interface with extensive hints and information on\nhealth, performance and temperature of the hard drive(s)\nSignificantly extended support for external USB hard drives and\nsolid state drives (SSDs)\nSupport of S.M.A.R.T self-test (if supported by the hard drive)\nAdjustment of the noise level and power management of your hard\ndrive(s) (if supported by the hard drive)\nData recovery  recovering deleted files and folders\nFully automatic, proactive defragmentation of the hard\ndrive(s)\nOnline retrieval of achieved benchmark results of your hard\ndrive model(s)\n\nComplete Monitoring:\n\nAshampoo HDD Control 2 provides complete monitoring of your hard\ndrive(s). The software supports not only all common IDE and\nserial ATA hard drive(s), but also provides improved support for\nexternal USB hard drives and solid state drives (SSDs).\n\nThe extended user interface gives an overview of the status of\nyour hard drives health, performance and temperature. It also\noffers lots of technical information on supported features and\ntheir current status. Furthermore the software supports the\nS.M.A.R.T self-test to check for electric and mechanic problems\nof hard drives as well as adjustment of the noise level and the\npower management (if supported by the hard drive).\n\nConstant monitoring enables the software to recognize a hard\ndrive failure early. Let Ashampoo HDD Control 2 notify you of a\npossible failure, for example via e-mail, if you are not near\nyour computer.\n\nBenchmark\nThe benchmark function checks the performance of your hard\ndrive(s) and provides a clear, graphic overview of the\nperformance evaluation and information on data transfer rates and\naccess times. In order to get more information on the performance\nof your hard drive(s) you can compare your benchmark results with\nthose of other users with the same hard drive model. Therefore a\ndatabase retrieves online information on the on average achieved\nbenchmark results of your hard drive model(s).\n\nMonitoring at a glance:\nMonitoring of all common IDE and serial ATA hard drive(s)\nImproved support of chip sets in external USB hard drives and\nsolid state drives (SSDs)\nPermanent real-time monitoring (also for multi-user systems)\nSupport of S.M.A.R.T self-test (if supported by the hard drive)\nand evaluation of S.M.A.R.T log sectors (for analysis by the\nhard drive manufacturer)\nAdjustment of the automatic acoustic management (if supported\nby the hard drive)\nAdjustment of the advanced power management (if supported by\nthe hard drive)\nGraphic analysis to check for flawed sectors on your hard\ndrive(s)\nDetailed technical information on your hard drive(s) and its\nfeatures, for example ATA and SATA features etc.\nExtended user interface with improved overview of health,\nperformance and temperature status of your hard drive(s)\nAnalysis shows information on disk utilization of hard\ndrives(s) including space usage of different file formats\nAutomatic detection of new, external devices\nBenchmark function for performance evaluation and online\ncomparison\n\nCareful Maintenance:\n\nDont you find it annoying to clean up your hard drive(s)\nregularly and to delete temporary or unused files in order to\ngain more disc space\n\nFrom now on Ashampoo HDD Control 2 will automatically do this job\nfor you. You wont have to spend time on going through all your\nfolders. With just a few clicks the software finds unused files\nand Internet traces on your hard drive(s). Those will then\ndisplayed in a list and can be erased, if necessary.\n\nInstead of transferring files and folders into the computers\nrecycle bin you can select and delete them directly in Ashampoo\nHDD Control 2. If you want to delete files and folders\nirretrievably, dragging them into the recycle bin will not be\nenough. Ashampoo HDD Control 2 now offers different erasing\nmethods, to delete files and folders irretrievably from your hard\ndrive(s).\n\nMaintenance at a glance\nDeletion of unnecessary files with the Drive Cleaner and\nInternet Cleaner\nCreation of an exceptions list for files and cookies that\nshouldnt be erased\nOption to add own file filters\nDeletion of Internet traces\nData destruction of files and folders with different erasing\nmethods (e.g. with several overwrite processes)\n\nFully Automatic Defragmentation:\n\nA defragmentation is a way to rearrange the data on a hard drive\nto increase performance. If an element, for example a file on the\nhard drive, is erased, an empty space will occur there.\n\nThis empty space is filled again when a new element is saved on\nthe hard drive. If the space isnt big enough, the new element is\nbroken up into fragments. These will then be placed into\ndifferent places on the hard drive to fill empty spaces.\n\nAfter some time the PC will need longer to read files, because,\nfirst of all, it has to assemble all fragments. Therefore it is\nvery important to do a defragmentation regularly, in order to to\nmaintain the hard drives performance.\n\nAmong the common methods Ashampoo HDD Control 2 uses the\nso-called &quot;proactive&quot; defragmentation, which makes use of your\nwork breaks to analyze the level of disk fragmentation and do a\nfully automatic defragmentation, if necessary.\n\nData recovery for emergencies:\n\nIts very annoying, if important data are deleted by mistake.\nWith Ashampoo HDD Control 2 these files might not be lost\nforever.\n\nThe software offers to recover deleted files and folders with the\nintegrated data recovery. Just select the relevant files and\nrestore them with Ashampoo HDD Control 2.\n\nRequirements:\n\nOperating System:\nWindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP, Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® (32bit/64bit) and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\n(32bit/64bit)\nComputer:\nAny computer that runs one of the above operating systems at a\nreasonable speed.\nMain Memory (RAM):\nAt least a minimum of 512 MB RAM should be available on your\nsystem.\nHard Drive Space:\n35 MB hard disk space.\nOther:\nFull administrative rights are required to use the program.\n\nSupported USB-Devices:\nWestern Digital\n- WD 3200AAJ External\n\nFor More Info on Ashampoo HDD Control 2 Visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ashampoo.com/en/uk/pin/0165/System%20Utilities/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ashampoo.com/en/uk/pin/0165/System%20Utilities/&lt;/a&gt;\nAshampoo-HDD-Control-2\n\nTE Release Filename: tahc207x.zip\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\nInstall ashampoo_hdd_control_2_2.07_sm.exe.

On first impressions, their hale and hearty delivery is certainly pleasing enough; but then so are most acts on the scene these days.\n\nFrom an instrumental viewpoint the music here has a warm lilt that would easily put a blush on the cheek of a many a cÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ilidh-goer. However, one shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be lulled into getting all cosied-up.\n\nAs what really gives the group their power and demands attention is their hair-raising collective voice. The best example of this is the title track, featuring goose-bump-inducing three-part harmonies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an extraordinary sound.\n\nMuch of the success of the album is down to its immediacy and directness. Unadorned by any studio trickery, when turned up loud (which is highly recommended) itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost like having the three Kittiwakes in the room with you.\n\nThe in-your-face attitude in DennyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singing combined with some haunting and poignant writing, as well their intricate but always robust playing, makes this a wonderfully bright and highly original debut.\n\nCD  ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/28/the-kittiwakes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/28/the-kittiwakes/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1fdae227ef72b15dfaa1990dbb28777c0b44a0","amp;dn":"The+Kittiwakes...Lofoten+Calling%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1fdae227ef72b15dfaa1990dbb28777c0b44a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,31,218,226,39,239,114,177,93,250,161,153,13,187,40,119,124,11,68,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

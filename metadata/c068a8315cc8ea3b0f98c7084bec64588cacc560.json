Sunman\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Eyes are an indie rock outfit from the mountains of Oregon and while they casually brag of their diet of berries and twigs, hand-me-down clothing and ability to abstain from using running water to remain more in touch with the wildernessez, their music is an interesting varietal of culturez.\n\nUtilizing an instrumentation wheelhouse filled with rock staples as well as an accordion, trumpet and a violin, there is this distinct feeling of being up to my elbows in exile inside of a vodka-fueled fog in a Russian bath-house where I'm being swatted at with branches and told to eat salted fish. Animal Eyes sound like a drunk, yet polite, caravan of musicians traveling in a rickety VW horse drawn carriage where they sing for food, and wash dishes for the sexual favors they are unable to complete in the back of the carriage.\n\nThe album I've been listening to, Found In The Forrest, is as odd and scattered as I could have hoped for, and the aforementioned accordion is the single element that takes this from decent to downright fucking awesome. Sure, there's the rock and roll sass, but the listless college hippy vibe is incomplete without the eclectic instrument-insertion of the accordion and I can't imagine this band sounding as endearing without it....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c068a8315cc8ea3b0f98c7084bec64588cacc560","amp;dn":"Animal+Eyes+-+Found+in+the+Forest+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c068a8315cc8ea3b0f98c7084bec64588cacc560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,104,168,49,92,200,234,59,15,152,199,8,75,236,100,88,140,172,197,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

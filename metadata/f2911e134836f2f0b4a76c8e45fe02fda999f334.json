Enjoy! :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057244/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057244/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Leather Boys (1964) \n\nDirector : Sidney J. Furie\n\n\n Rita Tushingham ...  Dot \n Colin Campbell ...  Reggie 'Dodgy'\n Dudley Sutton ...  Pete \n Gladys Henson ...  Gran \n Avice Landone ...  Reggie's Mother \n Lockwood West ...  Reggie's Father \n Betty Marsden ...  Dot's Mother \n Martin Matthews ...  Uncle Arthur (as Martin Mathews) \n Johnny Briggs ...  Boy Friend \n James Chase ...  Les \n Geoffrey Dunn ...  Mr. Lunnis \n Dandy Nichols ...  Mrs. Stanley \n Elizabeth Begley ...  Woman Receptionist \n Valerie Varnam ...  Brenda \n Jill Mai Meredith ...  June (as Jill Meredith) \n\n\nRecorded from digital TV broadcast . I am uploading because commercial DVD is apparantly of bad quality [ some say that company who released it do not own rights ie they bootlegging it &amp; amazon is or was selling this version ] and the best version is TV broadcast which this is and is rarely shown. Only bad thing is talking over end credits slightly. Also , in the divx conversion the aspect ratio might have changed . It is in 16:9 but at beginning they display full wide so all credits are visible &amp; correct then it formats back to 16:9 . Probably ok on a 16:9 LCD TV but in windows media player it plays wrong aspect ratio .\n\nI will try other conversions and upload, but for now,  enjoy...\n\nIf anyone HAS the DVD version please upload so we can compare.\n\n*FYI  ..Every year there is a 'Leather Boys Run' . This a ride [ on classic British bikes of course ] to some of the film locations WITH Colin Campbell , the lead actor who played 'Dodgy'  see this link for more info....\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hi-starclassics.co.uk/Leather%20Boys%20Run%20091108/lbr091108.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hi-starclassics.co.uk/Leather%20Boys%20Run%20091108/lbr091108.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nreviews from amazon : \n\n&quot;Very interesting as a period film. If you are into Sixties british bikes and the culture of that time, then you must see this film. There are some excellent shots of the famous Ace Cafe on the North Circular in London. &quot;\n\n&quot;The film is a classic of it's time. Viewed now, the acting can look disjointed or even amateur. That however is the beauty of the portrayal. Set in 1960's Britain, it paints a picture of social order and sexuality being stretched to new boundaries, never before touched by the British cinema in such a manner. Up the Junction, Quadrophenia and many other British 'social culture' films owe much to this timeless work, as it does to it's textual predecessors, namely romeo and Juliet. At a more basic level, it is a period piece, with beautiful motorcycles,road racing scenes, sexy leather and use of the world famous Ace Cafe, which thankfully is now thriving once again. Th plot is simple and does sometimes drag slightly, but that adds to the realism of the film itself. . As much a British Classic as 'American grafitti' is for the US. Definitely one to watch. &quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2911e134836f2f0b4a76c8e45fe02fda999f334","amp;dn":"the+leather+boys+1964+DVDR++SP%C3%82%C2%A3%C3%82%C2%A3DTWIN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2911e134836f2f0b4a76c8e45fe02fda999f334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,145,30,19,72,54,242,240,180,167,108,142,69,254,2,253,169,153,243,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

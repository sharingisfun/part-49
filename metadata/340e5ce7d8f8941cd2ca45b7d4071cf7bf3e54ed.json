Trainspotting\ndidn&amp;#039;t cross my mind once during this film. I liked Trainspotting\nwhen it came out, but if there was one criticism you could make\nit was that the film took itself a little too seriously.\nThankfully this film doesn&amp;#039;t and is all the better for it.\nEverything about it feels fresh and you really get the feeling\nthat everyone involved enjoyed making it. The acting has a nice\nimprovised quality and script is a perfect mix of playful whimsy\nand taut storyline.\nIf you got out the wrong side of the bed, don&amp;#039;t go and see this.\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for an enjoyable and refreshing 90 minutes that\nrestores your faith in low budget films, buy a ticket.\n\nCast: \nMatt Frewer ... Jason Taylor \nJoey Beck ... Sheldon \nWes Bentley ... Royce \nRaoul Bhaneja ... Omar \nGreg Bryk ... Abel \nRandy Butcher ... Hockey Goalie \nMaggie Castle ... Treena \nJoe Dinicol ... Jeremy Taylor \nDerek Gilroy ... Squinty \nTaryn Manning ... Matilda \nJames McQuade ... Gary \nMark Parr ... Anthony \nJordan Prentice ... Martin \nDax Ravina ... Seamus \nAllan Redford ... Theo \nScott Speedman ... Dexter \nShayne Wyler ... Todd \n\n\nHope you all have a nice 2008!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340e5ce7d8f8941cd2ca45b7d4071cf7bf3e54ed","amp;dn":"Weirdsville.Dvdscr.Xvid-maz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340e5ce7d8f8941cd2ca45b7d4071cf7bf3e54ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,14,92,231,216,248,148,28,210,202,69,183,212,7,28,247,191,62,84,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Since the band's formation, they have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, making them one of the largest grossing rock bands in recent years. The band has released three consecutive studio albums that have debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.\n\n\nDescription\n\n&quot;Another Way to Die&quot; is a song by American rock band Disturbed, released as the first single from their fifth studio album, Asylum. Airplay for the single began on the morning of June 14, 2010. That same day, a lyric video was posted by the band on their officialchannel and was released as a digital download on June 15, 2010 via iTunes.\n\nOn its release date, &quot;Another Way to Die&quot; reached #1 in the iTunes music store's rock section.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe band shot a music video for the track directed by Robert Schober (also known as Roboshobo) and was released on August 9th. The concept perfectly fits the song which has environmental theme. The Video depicts a News channel featuring the destruction caused to the environment.\n\nIn an interview with The Pulse of Radio, frontman David Draiman explained how the track contains some very timely subject matter:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObviously it's referring to the global catastrophe that we know as global warming, and the effects that it continues to have on our planet; our irresponsibility in doing what we do as species, our constant appetite, our constant consumption at all costs. No matter what is destroyed, no matter what is laid to waste. And, certainly, what's happening in the Gulf now is horrific.&quot;\n\n\nLyrics\n\nThe indulgence of our lives has cast a shadow on our world.\nOur devotion to our appetites betrayed us all.\nAn apocalyptic plight.\nMore destruction will unfold.\nMother Earth will show her darker side and take her toll.\n\nIt's just another way to die.\n\nThere can be another reason why.\nYou know we should have seen it coming.\nConsequences we cannot deny will be revealed in time.\nGlaciers melt as we pollute the sky.\nA sign of devastation coming.\nWe donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need another way to die.\nCan we repent in time?\n\n[Pre-chorus:]\nThe Time bomb is ticking and no one is listening.\nOur future is fading.\nIs there any hope weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll survive?\n\n[Chorus:]\nStill, we ravage the world that we love.\nAnd the millions cry out to be saved.\nOur endless maniacal appetite.\nLeft us with another way to die.\nIt's just another way to die.\nCan we repent in time?\n\nGreed and hunger led to our demise.\nA path I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe we followed.\nBlack agendaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rooted in a lie.\nWill we repent in time?\nSpecies fall before our very eyes.\nA world that they cannot survive in left them with another way to die.\nAre we dead inside?\n\n[Pre-chorus]\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\nCan we repent in time?\nIt's just another way to die.\nCan we repent in time? \n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFile size                        : 68.0 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 15s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 230 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nDuration                         : 4mn 15s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 2 104 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 31.9 Mbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 29.917 fps\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nStream size                      : 64.1 MiB (94%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nDuration                         : 4mn 15s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 124 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 141 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 3.77 MiB (6%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6c05faabd5edfd5384074727e280d440da81c3","amp;dn":"Another+Die+-+Disturbed+%28HD+720p%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6c05faabd5edfd5384074727e280d440da81c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,108,5,250,171,213,237,253,83,132,7,71,39,226,128,212,64,218,129,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

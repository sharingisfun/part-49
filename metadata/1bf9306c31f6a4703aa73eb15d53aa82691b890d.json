Released on February 28, 2005 in the United Kingdom and March 15, 2005 in the United States, the single peaked at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lopez's tenth top twenty single in the U.S.; it also peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first chart-topper in the UK for four years since 2001's &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;.\n\nThe main video, directed by Francis Lawrence, depicts Lopez playing different characters at a nightclub: a DJ (the main character), a Go-Go dancer dancing upon the bar, a bartender, a nerdy, shy girl, a superstar, and other personalities attending the club. The end of the song features Marc Anthony's daughter, ArianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½portrayed as the little sister to the DJ characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, singing along with the music as the DJ is at work. It received four nominations at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Dance Video, Best Direction, Best Choreography, and Best Editing.\n\nThe song was written by Rich Harrison and produced by Harrison and Cory Rooney. It is most notable for its looping, blaring horn sample usage of a part of the 1974 song &quot;Soul Power '74&quot;, written by James Brown and performed by Maceo &amp; the Macks.\n\nThe song was originally recorded by Usher as &quot;Ride&quot; but did not make his 2004 album Confessions. There was a big yet publicly quiet dispute between Lopez and Usher for &quot;stealing&quot; the song. In the end, Lopez got the song and also used much of his original verses for the bridge &quot;So much we got to say but so little time&quot;, etc.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf9306c31f6a4703aa73eb15d53aa82691b890d","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Lopez+-+Get+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf9306c31f6a4703aa73eb15d53aa82691b890d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,249,48,108,49,246,164,112,58,167,62,177,93,83,170,130,105,27,137,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Now you have to find all the        \n    flags.                                                                \n    Finding the flags faster earns more bonus points.  Here and there     \n    throughout the maze you'll find items that help you, like potions,    \n    a loaf of bread, or rocket-boots.  (Nothing washes down a loaf of     \n    bread like a potion.  But trust me: you should wait at least 30       \n    minutes before using the rocket boots.)  Beware!  There are a few     \n    items that you don't want to pick up.... Features: - Mazes come in    \n    six different sizes with up to nine flags. - Mazes are randomized,    \n    so every game is different. - Multiple navigation options; touch      \n    main maze display, movement pad, or tilt to move. - Tireless          \n    animated avatar. - Only have a few minutes to play?  Small mazes      \n    can be completed in a minute or two. - The biggest take several       \n    hours. Your games are automatically saved so you can always take a    \n    break and pick up where you left off later. With Hedge Maze Deluxe    \n    you're guaranteed to get hours and hours of &quot;hedgy&quot; entertainment.    \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.farwellsoftware.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.farwellsoftware.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                       \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                 ..:INSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES:..               \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Double click on .ipa and then synchro your iphone with itunes.       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: IMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Start CORE10k.EXE to verify that this release comes really from    \n       CORE.

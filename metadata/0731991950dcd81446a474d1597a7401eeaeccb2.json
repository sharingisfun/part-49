It's an idea that most of us would rather not face -- that within the next century, life as we know it could come to an end. Our civilization could crumble, leaving only traces of modern human existence behind.\n\nIt seems outlandish, extreme -- even impossible. But according to cutting edge scientific research, it is a very real possibility. And unless we make drastic changes now, it could very well happen. Experts have a stark warning: that unless we change course, the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of population growth, dwindling resources and climate change has the potential to converge in the next century with catastrophic results. \nIn order to plan for the worst, we must anticipate it. In that spirit, guided by some of the world's experts, ABC News' &quot;Earth 2100,&quot; hosted by Bob Woodruff, will journey through the next century and explore what might be our worst-case scenario.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 23mn 6s 960ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 040 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb\n\nPS: The last 60 seconds or so is missing due to channel cutoff for Breaking News.

It is not the\nultimate song speaking in respect of the lyrics, however\nit is one of the best songs ever recorded for its beautiful\nmelody and sound of the words spoken.\n\n\nIt would have been better to include &quot;aint no sunshine&quot;\nby Tom Jones rather than Green Green grass - for this\ncollection - and so look for the included bonus track\nas indicated.\n\nLikewise &quot;Have i told you lately&quot; would have been the best\nsong from Rod Stewart's collection of offerings\nrather than the song by him we instead found on the CD. \nThat said, I opted for the bonus track of the title\nby the original artist - Van Morrison in grand style\nequally!\n\n\nAlso the 40s and 50s is the best place to reach\nback to if you do the theme justice and in this\nrespect please look to our other postings here \ntoo as I have lots already previously launched\nfor you to enjoy and to build up a collection\nwith.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\n\nThe Ultimate Ballads Album Classic Love (2009 CD) (musicfromrizzo)\n\nvaried bitrates\n\n(Bomus Track) Van Morrison - Have I Told You Lately\n(Bonus track) Eric Clapton - Layla (Orig vers - unplugged)\n(Bonus track) Tom Jones - Ain't No Sunshine\n\nCat Stevens - The First Cut is the Deepest\nChris De Burgh - Lady in Red\nElton John - Your Song\nEngelbert Humperdinck - The Last Waltz\nJosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Carreras - Be My Love\nLionel Richie &amp; Diana Ross - Endless Love\nLionel Richie - Hello\nLuciano Pavarotti - Caruso\nPlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cido Domingo - Flower Song\nRighteous Brothers - Unchained Melody\nRod Stewart - You Wear it Well\nRussell Watson - Nella Fantasia\nRussell Watson and Lulu - The Prayer\nStevie Wonder - My Cherie Amour\nThe Moody Blues - Nights in White Satin\nTom Jones - Green Green Grass of Home\nVittorio - Maria West Side Story\nWalker Brothers - The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf38f80631de04bde65fa017d3da9cfe7f2d86f5","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Ballads+Album+-+Classic+Love++%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf38f80631de04bde65fa017d3da9cfe7f2d86f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,56,248,6,49,222,4,189,230,95,160,23,211,218,156,254,127,45,134,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The mission: To seek out a mysterious Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, whose army has crossed the border into Cambodia and is conducting hit-and-run missions against the Viet Cong and NVA. The army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane and Willard's job is to eliminate him! Willard, sent up the Nung River on a U.S. Navy patrol boat, discovers that his target is one of the most decorated officers in the U.S. Army. His crew meets up with surfer-type Lt-Colonel Kilgore, head of a U.S Army helicopter cavalry group which eliminates a Viet Cong outpost to provide an entry point into the Nung River. After some hair-raising encounters, in which some of his crew are killed, Willard, Lance and Chef reach Colonel Kurtz's outpost.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2141c3bd222d7047f3f5b735550a7d61d532a90","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Now+Redux+%281979%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2141c3bd222d7047f3f5b735550a7d61d532a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,20,28,59,210,34,215,4,127,63,91,115,85,80,167,214,29,83,42,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The song enjoyed immense popularity with both country and pop audiences when it was released in 1975.\n\n&quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; was certified gold for sales of 1 million units by the Recording Industry Association of America. \n\nThe song became Glen Campbell's signature song and won numerous awards from the Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music and American Music Awards. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Song as well as for Record of the Year, but did not win.\n\nReleased in May 1975, &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; immediately caught on with both country and pop audiences. The song spent that summer climbing both the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot 100 charts before peaking at No. 1 by season's end - three non-consecutive weeks on the country chart, two weeks on the Hot 100.\n\nDuring the week of September 13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that was the week the song returned to No. 1 on the Billboard country chart, after having been nudged out for a week by &quot;Feelins'&quot; by Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; topped both the country and Hot 100 charts simultaneously. This was the first time a song had accomplished the feat since November 1961, when &quot;Big Bad John&quot; by Jimmy Dean turned the trick.\n\n&quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; was one of six songs released in 1975 that topped both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Hot Country Singles charts. The other songs were &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot; by Freddy Fender; &quot;(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song&quot; by B.J. Thomas, &quot;Thank God I'm a Country Boy&quot; and &quot;I'm Sorry&quot;/&quot;Calypso,&quot; both by John Denver; and &quot;Convoy&quot; by C.W. McCall.\n\nThe song was also the sole Glen Campbell track in a promotional-only compilation album issued by Capitol records entitled &quot;The Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot; (Capitol SPRO-8511/8512), that was distributed to record stores during the 1976 Holiday season as part of Capitol's &quot;Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot; campaign, which promoted 15 &quot;Best Of&quot; albums released by the record label.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3b4ce0111c07aa00d8776129708aab3938b7b1","amp;dn":"Glen+Campbell+-+Rhinestone+Cowboy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3b4ce0111c07aa00d8776129708aab3938b7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,59,76,224,17,28,7,170,0,216,119,97,41,112,138,171,57,56,183,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In 1999 the line-up was completed with Julio CÃƒÂ©sar Markus (guitar) &amp; Luis Alberto Luna (vocals).In 1998 the band recorded a demo-tape, getting outstanding reviews. In 1999 AZEROTH recorded their first album, but this Cd wasnÃ‚Â´t released Ã‚Â´cos the band wasnÃ‚Â´t satisfied with the work done by the vocalist.Finally, the band re-recorded the album with two singers: Christian Bertoncelli (Imperio) &amp; Andrian Barilari (Rata Blanca). This recording was produced, mixed &amp; mastered by Charlie Bauenfeind (Angra, Helloween, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray) at Mission Digital Studios in Hamburg (Germany). The cover artwork was painted by Eric Philippe (Rhapsody, Riot, Luca Turilli...) Azeroth has a new line up with the guitar player Oscar Castro, Diego Valdez (voice) &amp; one guest keyboardist. Azeroth has opened a new &amp; promising era for the Heavy Metal with Spanish lyrics. \n\nFernando Ricciardulli  (bass)\nJuan Manuel Villagra (guitar)\nMarÃƒÂ­a Eugenia Ricciardulli (drums)\nMÃƒÂºsicos invitados: Christian Bertoncelli (vocals: tracks 3, 5, 6, 9)\nAdriÃƒÂ¡n Barilari (vocals: tracks 2, 4, 5, 8).\n\nTotal time: 44:02\nFormat: mp3 CBR 160 kbps, 44,1 kHz, Joint Stereo\nEncoded by Xing\n\nTracklist:\n01.

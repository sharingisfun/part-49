From 1985 to 1991 they used the name Panta Rhei, giving many live-performances with Bianca&amp;#039;s expressive voice and Hero&amp;#039;s synths, tapes and electronics.\n\nAlthough many of their concerts were recorded, apart from a few short appearances on sampler-discs and -cassettes of the time there is only one Panta Rhei-album available: Weird Duck (1998, initially released as a cassette in 1988, COM Records CD02). Nonetheless they reached a cult-state in the Netherlands, owing to their music on VPRO-radio and a remarkable 1990- televisionperformance.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a Wild World was recorded at de Wilde Wereld, a theatre run by students of the Wageningen University of Life Sciences. Bianca sang and used small stones for percussion-effects, Hero played his synths plus a Commodore 64 with his own Herosynth JJ64-software, turning this ancient personal computer into a double-joystick-controlled synthesizer-randomizer that produced nice random-drawings besides. Among his other assets were 2 cassettedecks with prepared tapes (as Wageningen lies amid the Dutch ?bible-belt?, he of course started the concert with the words of a confused reverend).\n\nThis album shows the avant-garde of the eighties at its amazing peak in a world that was confronted with the impact of computers, the first cd&amp;#039;s and multi-channel television at the same time- dazedly coping with an outbreak  of data-overflow.\n\nBianca Holst studied at the Toneelschool Amsterdam to become an actress with Fact, Publiekstheater and Werkteater. Today she is performing as a composer and theatre-director with her ensemble Het Musisch Wu Wei Universum and Wouters Holst.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.biancaholst.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.biancaholst.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHero Wouters was a composer of music for film and theatre who had fled Amsterdam to live in the country. Although he preferred to work as a solo-artist his other groups include Dada di Musica, The TWO, Angelos Obscuros (with Legendary Pink Dots-singer Edward Ka-Spel) and Nul Kelvin. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.herowouters.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.herowouters.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01.

The machete cleaved off the arms and severed the throat of a gel torso while the grappling hook ripped into a pig carcass. The edge was given to the machete since the grappling hook wasn't designed to be a weapon.\n\n    * For mid-range weapons, the Mini Uzi was tested against the AK-47. The Mini Uzi emptied an entire clip into two targets inside a car with most of the hits being in the head and neck areas while Abdi Ali, wielding the AK-47, killed two targets at 50yds and two targets at 100yds while riding on a small skiff. The edge was given to the AK-47 for its longer range and firepower.\n\n    * For long-range weapons, the M60 was tested against the PKM against four moving targets. The PKM completed its test in 1m and 43s but jammed once while the M60 jammed twice. The edge was given to the PKM for its higher rate of fire and better mechanical reliability.\n\n    * For explosive weapons, the car bomb was tested against the RPG-7. Although the RPG-7 was portable and could be fired repeatedly at a distance, the edge was given to the car bomb for its better chance at killing multiple targets with its larger explosive payload.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to please seed\n\nPlease note I don't seed over night (GMT Time Zone)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66fd522de227d741db6e80cc039fb6f82b2683b2","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Warrior+S02E08+Somali+Pirate+vs.+Medellin+Cartel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66fd522de227d741db6e80cc039fb6f82b2683b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,253,82,45,226,39,215,65,219,110,128,204,3,159,182,248,43,38,131,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

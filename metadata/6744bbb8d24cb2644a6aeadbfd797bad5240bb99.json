Also, 3rd party companies get paid by the government to collect info on all of us. All the purchases we make. The spouse we might have or what kind of pets we have, or even our favorite color. Here we have an ex CEO of the company talking about all this. \n\nWatch as you see how some companies monitor all their employees even while they are away from work! \n\nFinally the video shows the infamous NSA and how more than 20,000 people working each day listen to your phone calls. Hear ex employees talking about it. \n\nThe sources are from MSNBC, Discovery Channel, and History Channel along with others. Not only is this evidence but it comes from high sources and it takes you right to the heart of where this is all happening.\n\nThe second video is about how every product that you buy in the future will have a computer chip in it. The video shows the process of RFID technology being put into place worldwide and how it will be used for total control. \n\nThis leads into the third film where the RFID technology is used in microchips that are implanted in the flesh of humans. This video also covers the topic of creating new humans through technology. \n\nPart four of this documentary has various Hollywood movie clips that bring parts 1-3 together giving examples how movies show us the future and what is planned for us.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*To connect with other seeders from other torrent sites copy this \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://.concen.org/announce.php?passkey=ee64d3038a8ebf8e9a57b214d3ffdee1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://.concen.org/announce.php?passkey=ee64d3038a8ebf8e9a57b214d3ffdee1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThen double click on the torrent in your torrent downloader and click paste to add it to your tracker list \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6744bbb8d24cb2644a6aeadbfd797bad5240bb99","amp;dn":"Inconvenient+Lie+%28Conspiracy.Theory%29.BBC.PBS.National.Geographic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6744bbb8d24cb2644a6aeadbfd797bad5240bb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,68,187,184,210,76,178,100,74,106,234,219,253,121,123,173,82,64,187,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

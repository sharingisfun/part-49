Though it was originally released as a stand-alone single in 1973 with the B-Side &quot;Ho! Ho! Ho! (Who'd Be a Turkey at Christmas)&quot;, peaking at #23 in the UK. Due to Billboard magazine editorial policy it was held off the Hot 100. It did, however, make #1 on a specially designated Christmas chart, and it appeared in the Cashbox Top 100 charts. It was later included as a bonus track on the 1995 remastered reissue of the album Caribou, even though it was released in the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days. It also appears on the albums Elton John's Christmas Party, Rare Masters, To Be Continued, and The Best Christmas Album In The World...Ever!.\n\nLyrics:\nWelcome to my Christmas song\nI'd like to thank you for the year\nSo I'm sending you this Christmas card\nTo say it's nice to have you here\nI'd like to sing about all the things\nYour eyes and mind can see\nSo hop aboard the turntable\nOh step into Christmas with me\n\nStep into Christmas\nLet's join together\nWe can watch the snow fall forever and ever\nEat, drink and be merry\nCome along with me\nStep into Christmas\nThe admission's free\n\nTake care in all you do next year\nAnd keep smiling through the days\nIf we can help to entertain you\nOh we will find the ways\nSo merry Christmas one and all\nThere's no place I'd rather be\nThan asking you if you'd oblige\nStepping into Christmas with me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df293e72932e0365023ae5d2dd54b99e56d5852","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Step+Into+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df293e72932e0365023ae5d2dd54b99e56d5852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,242,147,231,41,50,224,54,80,35,174,93,45,213,75,153,229,109,88,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

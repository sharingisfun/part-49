Donna, 51, says she was overwhelmed by her unruly 8-year-old adopted foster child and has temporarily given him to her daughter and son-in-law. She says the boy was riddled with behavioral problems and on the brink of institutionalization. What was supposed to be an interim solution has turned weeks into months, and they want Donna to step up and care for the boy, or terminate her parental rights. Pressed for an answer, what will Donna decide? Plus, find out who else DonnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family says sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also neglecting. And, the hard part should be over for this mother, but Renee says her 17-year-old daughter, Mikaela, is simply throwing her life away for a boyfriend six years her senior. When Dr. Phil speaks to MikaelaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boyfriend, how will he defend their relationship? Parents: If you have a child, a tween or a teenager, you do not want to miss this show!

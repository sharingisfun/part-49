Let alone come close for that matter. This is not TOOL, this CD is a musical interpritation(sp) of their music. If you say there isn't emotion and feeling in these songs, then you don't understand music. The instruments in these pieces of music reflect so much emotion and feeling in these songs and if you cannot relate to that, then just dont listen to it. I Love This CD! This album is by far much better than the other vocal Tribute CD. It is just a  different concept of TOOL that many people do not understand because it is put into a musical language, a powerful yet sometimes mistaken language. So if you truely like TOOL as I do, you will see that this CD is awesome and I guarantee that no other Tribute to TOOL will ever surpass the emotional feel and quality of this CD. So don't  pay attention to &quot;the 'one star' guy.&quot; This is a true music masterpiece. Open you  mind to it, and explore it... and I guarantee you will love it!

This album's song &quot;White Bird&quot; was the band's biggest hit.\n\nThe cover was designed by George Hunter and painted by Kent Hollister based on the cover of a housekeeping magazine from around 1900. The cover used an old version of the Columbia logo that George Hunter felt was fitted with the feel of the rest of the cover. The album cover is number 24 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 greatest album covers.\n\n   1. &quot;White Bird&quot; (6:11)\n   2. &quot;Hot Summer Day&quot; (5:51)\n   3. &quot;Wasted Union Blues&quot; (4:09)\n   4. &quot;Girl With No Eyes&quot; (3:51)\n   5. &quot;Bombay Calling&quot; (4:28)\n   6. &quot;Bulgaria&quot; (6:14)\n   7. &quot;Time Is&quot; (9:38)\n\nThis rip is from my remastered German import.\n\nAll of my rips are from the original CD and have embedded cover art.

If I have them, I will up them.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a9cfcf3a31d8fc58b878deefe13c91413cc922","amp;dn":"Its+A+Beautiful+Day+-+Its+A+Beautiful+Day+%28320k+MP3%29+%7Bsolstars%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a9cfcf3a31d8fc58b878deefe13c91413cc922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,169,207,207,58,49,216,252,88,184,120,222,239,225,60,145,65,60,201,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

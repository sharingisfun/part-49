This episode\n              will progress from bigger to bigger waves and explore\n              how these killers are born and what makes each unique.\n              We end the hour with the biggest recorded impact wave\n              in Earth's history: a mega Tsunami over a hundred feet\n              high destroying everything in its path. How did it\n              happen? How did the planet survive? And could we be\n              hit by a wave that big again?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d4f9eb8f93c77ff808316f1d9cbfe0e045b937","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Underwater.Universe.S01E01.Killer.Shockwaves.720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d4f9eb8f93c77ff808316f1d9cbfe0e045b937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,212,249,235,143,147,199,127,248,8,49,111,29,156,191,224,224,69,185,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Worse, the son's condition is probably not accidental. His notebooks are missing; people around him are dying under mysterious circumstances. Harry, introduced in Goddard's Into the Bluefinds a new sense of purpose with the discovery that he is a father, and he begins to investigate what happened and why. The answer lies under layers of deceit, greed, fear, madness, and genius and leads Harry into unexpected byways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646893762038b98d8fde2a063055306884de2437","amp;dn":"Out+of+the+Sun+-+Robert+Goddard++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646893762038b98d8fde2a063055306884de2437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,104,147,118,32,56,185,141,143,222,42,6,48,85,48,104,132,222,36,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

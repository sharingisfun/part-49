The Masters are mysteriously killed, and the book of records is lost. It is rumored that Hsu Yin Fung (Jackie Chan) is the murderer, and he becomes the target of attack by other warriors. Hsu is helped by two women who love him dearly. When one of them is killed, Hsu and the other warriors go to the Shaolin Temple to seek out Master Tse Kung. They then learn that Chien-Tse of the Black Dragon Clan is the real murderer. Having secretly learned and perfected the technique of Snake and Crane, Hsu finally kills Chien in an unbelievable finale.\n\n \nCast: \n\nJackie Chan (Sing Lung)  ||  Nora Miao  ||  Kam Kong  ||  Kim Chin Lan  ||  Lee Ying Kwok  ||  Liu Ya Ying \n \nRunning Time: \n\n97 mins.

I also prefer the original language with english subs over the eng dub version. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMOVIE:\n------\nDuration:\t01:36:57\nSize:\t\t1149.79 MB\n------\nVIDEO:\n------\nSize:\t\t834.55 MB\nCodec:\t\tXvid\nResolution:\t720 x 576\nFrame Rate:\t25fps\nQuant.

The film itself doesn't have much substance, but then again who watches kung fu  for anything other than a fine display of ass kicking goodness :)\n\n\nPeace\n\n-&lt;SyMbIoTe&gt;-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231607f71d16238375b2c2b53336751124037308","amp;dn":"Snake+and+Crane+-+Arts+Of+Shaolin+%5B1978%5D+DvDrip+-+SyMbIoTe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231607f71d16238375b2c2b53336751124037308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,22,7,247,29,22,35,131,117,178,194,181,51,54,117,17,36,3,115,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

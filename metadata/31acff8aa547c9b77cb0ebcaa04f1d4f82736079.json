GAME.TYPE ........: Adventure\n\n\n\nProper note:\n\nSKIDROW uses direct calls to API in their crack, for example:\n\n00402A34: E85565F47B                 CALL 7C348F8EH\n00402A39: 59                         POP ECX\n00402A3A: 6804404000                 PUSH 00404004H\n00402A3F: 6800404000                 PUSH 00404000H\n00402A44: E875F2F37B                 CALL 7C341CBEH\n\nBecause modules are sometimes loaded at a different memory base, indirect\njumps for API calls are required.\nThat is why IAT exists.\n\nGame info:\n\nGhostly buccaneers Papa Doc, a vooju priest; Jane Starling, a lovely female\npirate; and Blue Belly, a bashful ships cook, must work together to discover\na way to reinhabit their bodies after being separated from them by a curse.\nThat wont be easy, however, as ghosts have only limited ability to directly\ninfluence the world around them.\n\nPirates, Ghosts, Puzzles and tons of Humour: developer Autumn Moon\nEntertainment is putting together a promising mix of gaming ingredients for\ntheir new PC adventure game Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island.\n\nAll three playable characters recently turned into ghosts and are now looking\nfor chances to get back into their living bodies.\n\nBeing a ghost is a curse: they are now invisible and inaudible to the living.\nTheres a lot more ghosts can take advantage of, but with that, the three\nghost pirates have also to deal with a lot of troubling hurdles: As ghosts,\nfor instance, they cant move physical objects, cant talk to living humans\nand can sometimes struggle at other things we take for granted. However there\nis a lot ghosts can take advantage of  their special ghostly powers more\nthan make up for this.\n\nThis mixture allows many innovative adventure gaming puzzles that will\nchallenge the players of Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island: How can you interact\nwith human beings, when nobody can see or even hear you? Are there other ways\nto communicate with the living? Thats the kind of questions players are\nasking themselves in order to solve the games puzzles.\n\n\n\n\n1. Unrar.\n2.

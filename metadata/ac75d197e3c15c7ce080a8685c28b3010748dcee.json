It's about the sudden, mysterious disappearance of bees. Yet again Nature is doing something inexplicable, and whatever science has to say about it will be, in the end, only a theory. Scientists will bring out more theories, but no explanations, when a more urgent dilemma hits the planet. It begins in Central Park. Suddenly and inexplicably, the behavior of everyone in the park changes in a most bizarre and horrible way. Soon, the strange behavior spreads throughout the city and beyond. Elliot, his wife, Alma, and Jess, the young daughter of a friend, will only have theories to guide them where to run and where to hide. But theories may not be enough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac75d197e3c15c7ce080a8685c28b3010748dcee","amp;dn":"The+Happening+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac75d197e3c15c7ce080a8685c28b3010748dcee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,117,209,151,227,193,92,124,224,128,168,104,92,40,179,1,7,72,220,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

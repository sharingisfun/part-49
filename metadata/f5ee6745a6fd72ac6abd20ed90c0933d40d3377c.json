Standing by two tablets, Jeff promises to introduce ten short stories, each about one of the commandments. A man survives a fall from a plane and his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e marries someone else before falling in love with a marionette; a surgeon causes the death of a patient and in prison tries to choose his mate; a woman encounters Jesus in Mexico and later confronts her husband on the Sabbath; twins and their mother reflect on fatherhood; covetous neighbors miss a chance to be heroes; and, between each story, Jeff's love triangle with Gretchen and Liz plays out. In the end, all the characters join in singing that it's all about love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ee6745a6fd72ac6abd20ed90c0933d40d3377c","amp;dn":"The+Ten+%282007%29+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ee6745a6fd72ac6abd20ed90c0933d40d3377c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,238,103,69,166,253,114,172,106,189,32,237,144,192,147,61,64,211,55,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

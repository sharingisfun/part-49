Julia Bradbury goes on an eye-opening journey to find out how. She is joined by the young consumers who use these products, from boy racers to a bride and groom-to-be, to uncover the surprising animal origins of our most popular items by following the transformation of each leftover body part all the way from the abattoir to the shop floor. In this episode, Julia discovers how the inedible parts of a cow can be turned into everything from flash car seats and tennis rackets to fashionable fastenings and posh plates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007fdf105550b0ec8e4c86b2a301e31fda36ebef","amp;dn":"Kill+It%2C+Cut+It%2C+Use+It%2C+S01E01+WS+PDTV+XviD-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007fdf105550b0ec8e4c86b2a301e31fda36ebef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,127,223,16,85,80,176,236,142,76,134,178,163,1,227,31,218,54,235,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

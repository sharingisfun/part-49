Well respected by his peers at US Border Patrol, and well loved by his family (wife Angela and 5 year old daughter Emily), Michael's world is suddenly threatened by secrets from his past. Michael was not always the respectable family man he now has become - he was a vicious Los Angeles gang member who turned his back on the gang and his own brutal ways. But no one can quit the gang, so when a chance encounter leads the gang to Michael in New Mexico, Michael is forced to find a way to protect his family, even if it means helping the psychotic gang leader Drake smuggle a truckload of drugs across the border.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146602260946ce1003e8a959e4f11752530df34a","amp;dn":"Linewatch+2008+DVDrip%28No+Rars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146602260946ce1003e8a959e4f11752530df34a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,102,2,38,9,70,206,16,3,232,169,89,228,241,23,82,83,13,243,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

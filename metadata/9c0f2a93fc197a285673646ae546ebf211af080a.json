On a train he meets a woman who tells him that she is going to Scotland Yard to report a series of murders in her village which have been regarded as accidents. Outside Scotland Yard though, she is run over and killed. Luke decides to investigate her story.......\n\nThe usual cast of middle class suspects, red herrings and loose ends left untied, but the director gives the story a more modern feel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c0f2a93fc197a285673646ae546ebf211af080a","amp;dn":"Murder+Is+Easy+-+Agatha+Christie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c0f2a93fc197a285673646ae546ebf211af080a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,15,42,147,252,25,122,40,86,115,100,106,229,70,235,242,17,175,8,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was originally taken from the Point Break soundtrack.\n\nAlthough the song was a hit, many die-hard Ratt fans do not consider it to be one of the band&amp;#039;s biggest hits since the song was written primarily by the credited songwriter, Steve Caton, although members Stephen Pearcy, Warren DeMartini, and Juan Croucier helped Caton in the songwriting process. This was Ratt&amp;#039;s first single recorded without guitarist Robbin Crosby who left the band the year before due to a drug addiction. The song was played during the ending credits of Point Break.\n\nThe music video for the song sees the band play on a beach, intercut with some clips from the 1991 action-thriller Point Break.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4124d878e6ad71e72c72aa19f016349c3efdf0","amp;dn":"Ratt+-+Nobody+Rides+For+Free","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4124d878e6ad71e72c72aa19f016349c3efdf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,65,36,216,120,230,173,113,231,44,114,170,25,240,22,52,156,62,253,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

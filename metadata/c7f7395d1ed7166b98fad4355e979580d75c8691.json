So what more could he possibly add after all these years, and his slew of #1 hits? Well, for the first time since the debut of his long career, George co-wrote 3 songs on the CD -- and his son, Bubba Strait, also had a hand in writing 4 songs on the album. Both of them teamed up to help pen the first single, &quot;Living For The Night&quot;, which is an amazing ballad. It's one of the strongest singles of 2009, and is quickly becoming yet another huge hit for his collection.\nThe whole album was recorded in Key West, Florida -- and it seems to have a nice overall laid back feel to it.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Twang                                                [02:56]\n02.Where have I been all my life                        [03:07]\n03.I gotta get to you                                   [03:10]\n04.Easy as you go                                       [03:22]\n05.Living for the night                                 [03:42]\n06.Same kind of crazy                                   [03:33]\n07.Out of sight out of mind                             [03:08]\n08.Arkansas dave                                        [03:19]\n09.The breath you take                                  [03:36]\n10.He's got that something special                      [03:23]\n11.Hot grease and zydeco                                [03:19]\n12.Beautiful day for goodbye                            [03:09]\n13.El rey                                               [02:27]\n____\n\n42:11 min\n62,10 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.

Mann, who has changed his style numerous times throughout his long career, is heard exclusively in a straight-ahead and bop context on this pair of studio dates.  Evans, who studied flute through his college years, rarely recorded with a flutist (Jeremy Steig joined him on a later record for Verve), though he was fond of the instrument; the capable Chuck Israels on bass and drummer Paul Motian round out the trio.  The low-key ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWillow Weep for MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and impressionist composer Erik SatieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gymnopedie bring out the lyricism of MannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing, though the trioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backing is very understated.  Things open up a bit with a sparkling take of Cole PorterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Love You.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  MannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two originals, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNirvanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCashmere,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite as memorable; substituting one of EvansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ compositions for either of them might have provided some additional spark.  Fans of either Herbie Mann or Bill Evans will want to acquire this enjoyable CD. ~ by Ken Dryden, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nHerbie Mann (Flute) \nBill Evans (Piano) \nChuck Israels (Double Bass) \nPaul Motian (Drums) \n\nHerbie Mann and Bill Evans - Nirvana Tracks:\n01  Nirvana (Herbie Mann) 5:51 \n02  Gymnopedie (Erik Satie) 3:18 \n03  I Love You (Cole Porter) 7:17 \n04  Willow Weep For Me (Ann Ronell) 5:34 \n05  Lover Man (Jimmy Davis/Roger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ramirez/Jimmy Sherman) 4:52 \n06  Cashmere (Herbie Mann) 6:44 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3f80c00e38c5b1a1f9c4c7b23e2c5bb564e264","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+and+Bill+Evans+-+Nirvana+%281962%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3f80c00e38c5b1a1f9c4c7b23e2c5bb564e264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,63,128,192,14,56,197,177,161,249,196,199,178,62,44,91,181,100,226,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

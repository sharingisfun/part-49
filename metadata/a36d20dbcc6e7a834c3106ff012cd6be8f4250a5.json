It provides for the following situations:\n\n    * setting up automated deployments;\n    * upgrading from older installations without network access;\n    * LVM and/or RAID partitioning;\n    * installs on systems with less than about 192MB of RAM (although note that low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment reasonably). \n\nPC (Intel x86) alternate install CD\n\nFor almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors.

For the first time cameras have been\ngranted full access to the Supreme Court of Western\nAustralian and the District Court of NSW where criminal cases\nare dealt with before judge and jury.\n\n\nThe series features a murder trial, a major assault, and a\nrobbery and assault trial.\n\n\nOn Trial takes viewers behind the scenes as they observe the\nemotional and legal journeys of the accused. Each case\nprovides key insights into often controversial legal processes,\nour adversarial legal system, and the day-to-day operation of\nour courts.\n\n\nOn Trial charts the stories of both prosecution and defence as\nthey undertake pre-trial preparations in the tense build-up\nbefore going to court. The series covers the jury selection\nprocess, opening addresses, examination of witnesses,\ncross-examination and the summing-up to juries and, if found\nguilty, sentencing. As well as charting the legal journey, the\nseries traces the intimate emotional stories of the characters\nthrough observational coverage outside the court.\n\n\nProduced by Ian Collie and Michael Cordell, the team\nresponsible for A Case for the Coroner, DIY Law, and\nSuspicious Minds, On Trial is another compelling courtroom\nseries that provides a rare insight into the criminal justice\nsystem and how people react under pressure.\n\n\nIn episode one, a man is accused of holding a pistol to the\nhead of another man and threatening to shoot him. Granted\nextraordinary access to the trial and both legal teams, this\ntwo-part story follows the defence as they argue that the\naccused was actually the victim, not the aggressor.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/geo/documentaries/interactive/ont&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/geo/documentaries/interactive/ont&lt;/a&gt;\nrial/\n\n\nEnjoy this nice new doco series from the ABC.\n\n\n \n\n\n _ W4F is looking for _\n\n 100mbit+ affil sites with archives\n\n Broadcast/Network/PPV Cappers with PDTV/HDTV Sources (US/UK/AU)\n\n People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping\n\n TV/WWE/MMA DVD Rippers/Suppliers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cabdfeaca9b8afbd8aada7aba3a6e4a9a5a7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Releasing TV since 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c71490ffb4a0b9a6dc07b6fe522958bc31ba8ef7","amp;dn":"On.Trial.Part1.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c71490ffb4a0b9a6dc07b6fe522958bc31ba8ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,20,144,255,180,160,185,166,220,7,182,254,82,41,88,188,49,186,142,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

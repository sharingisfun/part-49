The couple has a daughter and a son, the latter a member of the armed forces. When his weary major is ordered to take a vacation, the son talks him into a visit to his family home. Comedy endues when the Toth's go overboard trying to make things pleasant for the visiting major in hopes of an easier life for their son the soldier.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603322lg3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603322lg3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603366ht8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603366ht8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603705yx6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap1603705yx6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe audio is Hungarian i.e. original audio.\n\nP.S.

You solve problems every day of your life. Without realizing it, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve probably developed quite a few problem-solving skills. For example, say you plan to take the bus to school, but you miss it. You know youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in trouble. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one problem-solving skillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the ability to identify the problem. Immediately you consider your options. You could walk the five miles to school. You could ride your bicycle or use in-line skates. Your friend might pick you up, you could ask your mom or dad for a ride, or you could skip school. Coming up with lots of possible solutions is another problem-solving skill.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:299e2424fe000f6932757eb5856a17c6b026f835","amp;dn":"Problem_Solving","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"299e2424fe000f6932757eb5856a17c6b026f835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,158,36,36,254,0,15,105,50,117,126,181,133,106,23,198,176,38,248,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

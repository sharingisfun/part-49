His wife's lengthy illness drains his resources, and when he loses her, he loses everything. He refuses to accept government aid or other assistance, and gets a job at a fast-food restaurant, bringing home leftovers to feed his children, Willa (Jena Malone), 9, and Robbie (Shelton Dane), 11.\n\nPrestigious surgeon Dr. Michael Millerton (Bruce Davison) meets Willa when she visits his daughter, who is the same age. Willa, poorly dressed and very hungry, sneaks food from the kitchen. Michael loses a bet with his colleague, Dr. Vincent (Jeff Bridges), and takes his place donating service at the community clinic where Bill brings Willa with a bad cough and persistent headaches. The diagnosis, that the child is anemic and her immune system is weakened by poor nutrition, angers the struggling father.\n\nThrough tragedy, Bill and Michael, whose lives are poles apart, recognize their commonality as members of the human family - an understanding that could offer some sense of hope.\n================================================================================\n1 file:\nHidden in America.avi 1:34:53\n600x448\n23.97 fps\n699MB\n1006 kbps\n\nAudio:\nEnglish\nNo subtitles\nStereo\n128kb/s bitrate\n48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee698eaf17a427308dcb60354a589d6c7dce00c5","amp;dn":"Hidden+in+America+%281996%29+%28TV%29+-+Jena+Malone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee698eaf17a427308dcb60354a589d6c7dce00c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,105,142,175,23,164,39,48,141,203,96,53,74,88,157,108,125,206,0,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The single is scheduled for release on September 13, 2008 physically, and on September 16 digitally.\n\nThe song was co-written by urban artist &amp; producer Israel Cruz. &quot;Wiggle It&quot; was written in 2006 for the album, &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, but was not included due to Ricki-Lee stating that it did feel right on that mix of tracks. The track features a chorus sample from the 90&amp;#039;s hit &quot;Wiggle It&quot; by 2 In A Room.\n\nThe video for Wiggle It was shot on Tuesday, August 19th at the Valve Nightclub in Melbourne. It is intended to be a parody of the typical club video, with Ricki-Lee looking for someone to spend her night with and coming up only with a number of characters who are all wrong for her. The video features a cameo by Big Brother &amp;#039;06 contestant David Graham. The video premiered on Video Hits on Saturday, August 30th.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef6320ede8944fe123708641c9724677ac985db","amp;dn":"Wiggle+It+-+Ricki-Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef6320ede8944fe123708641c9724677ac985db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,246,50,14,222,137,68,254,18,55,8,100,28,151,36,103,122,201,133,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

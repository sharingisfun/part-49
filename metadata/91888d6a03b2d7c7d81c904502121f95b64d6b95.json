His backup group (organist Paul Griffin, guitarist Lord Westbrook, bassist Leonard Gaskin and drummer Herbie Lovelle) is fine in support, but the spotlight is almost entirely on Witherspoon throughout these ten concise performances. Highlights include &quot;No Rollin' Blues,&quot; &quot;S.K. Blues&quot; and &quot;Around the Clock.&quot; Witherspoon is in fine voice and the music is enjoyable.\n\nTracklist\n1.

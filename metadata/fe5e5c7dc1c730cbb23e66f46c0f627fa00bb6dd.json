Using straightforward, less-technical jargon, Clark and Pazdernik manage to introduce each chapter with a basic concept that ultimately evolves into a more specific detailed principle. This up-to-date text covers a wide realm of topics, including the forensics used in crime scene investigations, the burgeoning field of nanobiotechnology, bioethics and other cutting edge topics in today's world of biotechnology.\n\n    * An easy-to-use study guide that incorporates the most current, relevant journal articles from Cell Press  \n\n    * Full supplements including text and journal test bank, image gallery and online self quizzing\n\n    * Basic concepts followed by more detailed, specific applications with clear, color illustrations of key topics and concepts\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Clark has taught courses in Molecular Biology and Bacterial Physiology and Biochemistry at Southern Illinois University since 1981.

I got to thinking about electronic music and its genesis, asking myself where it all started and where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at now.\n\nAfter making 15 studio albums in 20 years, I knew that if I was going to record another one, I would simply have to make a change. Somewhere, at some time, I started experimenting with an old JUNO 6 and fell in love with sequences all over again. Apparently all ordered and logical, but then, the more I played and the deeper I listened, the more chaotic and unpredictable their sound became.\n\nLate in 2013 I started to record my sessions. Always in the middle of the night while the city was falling asleep. Changing Cities Berlin, Warsaw, Uzhgorod, Cologne, filled my head with childlike inspiration. At last, I was back, dreamily, in my element.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCover Image:\n&quot;Torrin, Skye&quot; from the series &quot;Abstract Exposures&quot;\nby Matthew Davidson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa86578095e131d6581c6cb55803c122bf5f0bf5","amp;dn":"Spyra+-+Staub+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa86578095e131d6581c6cb55803c122bf5f0bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,134,87,128,149,225,49,214,88,28,108,181,88,3,193,34,191,95,11,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

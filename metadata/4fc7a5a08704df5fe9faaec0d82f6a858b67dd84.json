It is compiled by FSGenesis using real world data in the form of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Natural Resources Canada (NRC), Centre for Topographic Information.\nThe default terrain mesh covering most of the world is 1223m horizontal resolution, that is, 1223m between elevation points. There are small areas of the Japan and the south Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, with 76.4m terrain. Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa is done in 76.4m.\n\nThe default terrain mesh covering the United States is generally 611.5m horizontal resolution, that is, 611.5m between elevation points. Small areas of the western United States are done in 153.2m, as well as the entire Caribbean. The Grand Canyon, Hawaii, Mount Rainier, Yosemite, and Catalina Island are done in 76.4m.\n\nFSGenesis terrain mesh is compiled in all available horizontal resolutions. Beginning with the lowest resolution that displays the most distant terrain from your aircraft all the way to the highest resolution, which displays immediately surrounding your aircraft.\n\nNorth America Terrain Mesh for FSX\n\nTaking advantage of the new, improved FSX terrain engine, this product will take your terrain detail to unimagined new heights.\n\nFeaturing an incredible 9.6m resolution for the United States (default is 38.2m), 19.1m resolution for Canada (default is 76.4m), and 38.2m resolution for Mexico (default is 306m), FSGenesis North America Terrain Mesh has been compiled from the latest, best available 10m NED, 23m CDED, and 30m INEGI source data.\n\nSize: 9.9 Gb\nSource data: 10m NED/23m CDED/30m INEGI/60m NED (AK)\nVers: 1.2\nUpdated: January 12, 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc7a5a08704df5fe9faaec0d82f6a858b67dd84","amp;dn":"FSX+-+FSGenesis+-+North+America+Terrain+Mesh+for+FSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc7a5a08704df5fe9faaec0d82f6a858b67dd84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,199,165,160,135,4,223,95,233,250,174,192,216,47,106,133,139,103,221,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

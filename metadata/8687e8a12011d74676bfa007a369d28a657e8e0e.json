Maybe you heard Scala&amp;#039;s version of &quot;With or Without You&quot; on your favorite radio station. You could of course also know the Scala girls from one of their live concerts.\n\nIt is a success story, a real dream for all the people involved in it. Today, more than 200 girls (16 - 26 years) are on the member list of Scala, but the choir started 10 years ago on a very small scale. The very first rehearsal took place on 2nd April 1996, with just 18 singers. The brothers-pianists&amp;#039; purpose was to work with &quot;voices&quot; in their free time. Obviously, a choir is ideal for this kind of experiment!  \n\nContent:\n========\n01. It Never Will Come Back\n02. Splinter\n03. Seashell\n04. I Will Bleed For You\n05. Raintears\n06. Woorden\n07.

The game, which is a modification of an older game, ?Quest for Saddam,? features six-levels, culminating in a gun battle with a character representing U.S. President George W. Bush. Each of these stages, given titles such as: ?Jihad beginning,? ?American?s Hell,? ?Searching for Bush,? and ?Bush hunted like a rat,? contain a Mujahid with several weapons traveling around a U.S. forces? camp, which is covered with pictures of Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. War nasheeds, jihadist songs, play in the background of each level. Upon completion of the game, ?Takbir Allahu Akbar? is shouted.\n\nThe Global Islamic Media Front announced recently the game with a video trailer and images of in-game action. According to the advertisement, the game was distributed for ?terrorist children?.)\n- SITE Institute\n\nNOTE:  I DO NOT ADVOCATE ANY OF THE VIEWS OR ACTIONS DEPICTED IN THIS GAME.  I AM UPLOADING THIS FOR HUMOR PURPOSES ONLY.\n\nThis game was downloaded from a bona-fide terrorist site, so I cannot guarantee that is free from spyware or malware.  It was downloaded on a Mac and scanned with the latest updates of both Norton and McAfee, so I believe it&amp;#039;s fairly secure, but don&amp;#039;t sent me any angry emails blaming me for any issues.

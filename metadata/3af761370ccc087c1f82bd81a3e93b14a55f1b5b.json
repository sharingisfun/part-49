Formed in 1997, Twiztid is composed of Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric, who perform under the respective personas of Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child. Spaniolo and Methric are former members of the group House of Krazees, which disbanded in 1997. \n\nTwiztidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth dip into the vaults is -- unsurprisingly -- a set for the hardcore fan; the kind of fan who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind some ragged edges. Here there are plenty, with numerous tracks coming off as half-baked ideas, but sometimes the lunacy works, like the opening joke Ã¢â‚¬Å“Magic Magic Ninja,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a perfect example of both dumb and fun juggaloo chanting. A jumbled set of remixes and collaborations fills in the rest while the usual Psychopathic guest stars, running from Boondox to Insane Clown Posse, makes this a release any hatchet-wielding fan must consider. Speaking of which, concerned parents should direct their attention to the front cover art, which promises Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flagrant Hand Gestures and How to Properly Swing an Axe!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n Also, includes songs with; Lil' Poot, Big Stank, Project Deadman, Mike E. Clark, Prozak, Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, E-40, Insane Clown Posse, Blaze Ya Dead Homie ABK, Boondox, And The R.O.C. \n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like Twiztid then buy all their shit, please support the artists you like this is years of hard work. Leave a comment &amp; rate this download &amp; please seed this takes alot of time &amp; effort I cant do it all myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af761370ccc087c1f82bd81a3e93b14a55f1b5b","amp;dn":"Twiztid+-2011-+The+Cryptic+Collection+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af761370ccc087c1f82bd81a3e93b14a55f1b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,247,97,55,12,204,8,124,31,130,189,129,163,233,59,20,165,95,27,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

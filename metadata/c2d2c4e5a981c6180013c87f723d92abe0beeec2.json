A film about a Russian mobster who orchestrates a crooked land deal where millions of dollars are up for grabs and all of London?s criminal underworld wants in on the action. Everyone from a dangerous crime lord to a sexy accountant, a corrupt politician and down-on-their-luck petty thieves conspire, collude and collide with one another in an effort to get rich quick.       \n\n     The story is interesting and the plot is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure.  It has also a very good amount of black humor, a characteristic of Ritchie's movies, and is full of twists and an unexpected ending.\n\n     The direction from Ritchie is excellent.   The first hour (especially the first 10-15 minutes) might seem a little slow to fans of Ritchie, but for the second half this movie takes on a very fast rhythm. \n     The cast is amazing, Gerard Butler gives a formidable performance. Thandie Newton is also very good. Tom Wilkinson is flawless as always and the secondary roles from Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid), Idris Elba (Mumbles) and Mark Strong (Archie) gave the movie good support. \n\n      In conclusion, RocknRolla is an entertaining movie that you will enjoy and that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'll also add that the soundtrack is great.  \n\n     Thanks and shout-out to Dave3737 h33t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d2c4e5a981c6180013c87f723d92abe0beeec2","amp;dn":"RocknRolla+%5B2008%5D+Dvd+Rip+Xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d2c4e5a981c6180013c87f723d92abe0beeec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,210,196,229,169,129,198,24,0,19,200,127,114,61,146,171,224,190,238,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

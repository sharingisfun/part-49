Inspired by the popular and notoriously bloody video game, Mortal Kombat provides a semblance of a plot as an excuse for rampant mayhem, with the evil alien forces challenging humanity to a kung fu battle to decide the Earth's fate. Following the failure of several previous human defenders, mankind's last chance lies with egotistical action film star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), tough but beautiful special agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), and vengeance-minded hero Liu Kang (Robin Shou). Under the guidance of inspirational sorcerer Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert), this unlikely trio faces off against a series of terrifying alien adversaries. As in the video game, the martial arts battles are the true point, with standard fighting combining with magical touches supplied by computer-generated effects. The dramatic content often resembles a Saturday morning cartoon, but Jonathan Scott Carlson's appropriately dank production design and the visually spectacular battle sequences made the film a hit amongst younger fantasy-action fans, spawning a sequel and a TV show.\n\nGspot Info~&gt;AVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Mortal Kombat (1995)[TabsmanRip][H33T][Release].avi\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,308 KB or 734,523,392 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:41:25 (145,892 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 839 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 118 kb/s (59/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.98r\u0002Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âª\nFrame Size...: 672x368 (1.83:1) [=42:23]\nSubs~&gt;NO\n\nTracker~&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73737dd237c01485880d515da29696332e0d8a77","amp;dn":"Mortal+Kombat+%281995%29%5BTabsmanRip%5D%5BH33T%5D%5BRelease%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73737dd237c01485880d515da29696332e0d8a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,115,125,210,55,192,20,133,136,13,81,93,162,150,150,51,46,13,138,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

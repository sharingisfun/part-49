Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is a police detective who, after discovering the aftermath of a particularly \n\ngruesome murder, is convinced that Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is up to his ugly tricks again. Matthews's hunch turns out to be \n\ncorrect, but the master criminal proves to be disconcertingly easy to capture. As it happens, Jigsaw is eager to be put \n\nbehind bars in order to throw the authorities off his trail as he once again punishes people who in his eyes have \n\ntransgressed the boundaries of acceptable moral behavior. But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they \n\nmust engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom, eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw, and they must \n\ntorture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks. Saw II was written by Leigh Whannell, who also \n\nscripted the first film.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated R  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t28 October 2005\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 3710 Kbps\n         * Audio - English 5.1, English 2.0\n         * Subs  - English, Spanish\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.

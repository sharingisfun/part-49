Also one of his first..... and BEST! It contains some of the most dreamy-type techno ever, and is more musical in style, rather than &quot;game music&quot; like his more recent works. Anyway this beautiful album is a must for all lovers of nice electronica and trance music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092bcdaa1bfea6f28e21db84664976c158c049fc","amp;dn":"Chris+Hulsbeck+in+the+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092bcdaa1bfea6f28e21db84664976c158c049fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,43,205,170,27,254,166,242,142,33,219,132,102,73,118,193,88,192,73,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

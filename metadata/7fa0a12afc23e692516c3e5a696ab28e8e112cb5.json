This means that it has been tested only by a relatively small group of users. We recommend that you use this version only with data for which you have a backup, especially the new functions like zipping with Unicode file names, or the FTP master password!\n\n\nWhat's new? \n\nFull Unicode support in most functions where it is possible, including FTP, ZIP packer, and plugin interfaces \n\nSupport for file names longer than 259 characters (up to 1022) in most file operations \n\nCompare by content allows to compare text files of different type, e.g. Ansi and UTF-8 \n\nThe current directory above the file lists can act as a clickable bar (&quot;breadcrumb bar&quot;) \n\nOption to show *.bar file in button bar as a popup menu instead of switching bars \n\nShow icons and subfolders in ftp connection dialog \n\nProtect the stored ftp passwords with a master password using AES256 encryption \n\nFTP, PORT mode: Allow to specify external IP address of the Internet router \n\nStart Lister, compare by content or synchronize dirs directly via command line parameters \n\nComments (Ctrl+Z) can now have a max. length of 4095 characters, and support line breaks \n\nSynchronize dirs: Option to synchronize also empty directories, option to copy just specific file properties (like the time) \n\nCreate CRC checksums now also supports the SHA1 hash format \n\nAllow to use the Windows key for user-defined hotkeys \n\nOn 64-bit Windows, allow to use 64-bit shell extensions in local menu (context menu) \n\nNew internal command cm_SwitchX64Redirection to turn redirection of system32 dir under 64-bit Windows on/off \n\nInternal unpacking of multi-part RAR archives, and RAR archives where the file names are encrypted \n\nCopy files/directories to multiple target directories (or lnk files pointing to directories) in one operation \n\nQuick search with search dialog: Show button which allows to show only files/dirs matching the filter \n\nSwitch character encodings in Lister \n\nNew internal association system, e.g. for using Total Commander from an USB stick \n\nSee history.txt for all additions and fixes\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ghisler.com/750beta.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ghisler.com/750beta.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built up on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa0a12afc23e692516c3e5a696ab28e8e112cb5","amp;dn":"Total+Commander+v7.50b4+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa0a12afc23e692516c3e5a696ab28e8e112cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,160,161,42,252,35,230,146,81,108,62,90,105,106,178,142,142,17,44,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

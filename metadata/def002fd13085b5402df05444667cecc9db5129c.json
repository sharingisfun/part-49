Oh well, its fine. \n              Unfortunately for them, their release has Bad AR\n              Calculating AR % error: (Original AR - Release  \n              AR)/Original AR x 100 , and in this case the    \n              original movie AR is 1,85 while their rip is    \n              1,773 which leads to a 4,16% AR error, and acco-\n              rding to tdx rules &quot;Video encodes must be withi \n              4% of the original aspect ratio.&quot;. So next time \n              you want to proper someone,  make it right or   \n              dont even try it. Enjoy the real proper release \n              PS.

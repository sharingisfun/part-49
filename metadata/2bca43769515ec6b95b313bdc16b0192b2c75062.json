This stuff was known before the late 70s, people, and there are quote by Andrew Jackson, Woodrow Wilson, and a bunch of other presidents that show they knew exactly what was going on with international banking as well.  It's not like these things just came out of nowhere.  They're just being used, right now, to push the government and the American public into a system of global government which has been working for some time; only lately has it gotten so much press, though, because the last few plays are coming into maturity.  It's time to show everyone that the constitution has been usurped for some time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bca43769515ec6b95b313bdc16b0192b2c75062","amp;dn":"The+Money+Masters+%28full+set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bca43769515ec6b95b313bdc16b0192b2c75062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,202,67,118,149,21,236,107,149,179,19,189,193,107,1,146,178,199,80,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Trey and Lonnie were good friends and former band mates in a project called Mouthbreather which split a couple of years before. Trey found out they needed a drummer. And after just one jam they knew they had something different and exciting. They are a 3 piece with Lonnie on bass and vocals, Trey on drums, and Emily on guitar and vocals.\n\nCurrent line-up \nEmily - Guitar, Vocals\nLonnie - Bass, Vocals, Samples\nTrey - Drums \n\nReview:\nReview by JJ Koczan (StonerRock.com)\n\nShreveport,Louisiana is a good ways north and west of the fabled New Orleans, and likewise, Ketea offers a sound north and west of fabled Nola acts like EyeHateGod, Suplecs, Mystick Krewe of Clearlight, and Crowbar. Their emphasis, both musically and vocally, is on dynamics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ each of the six\nsongs on their Doom Dealer/The Church Within debut, Alpha, features finely honed changes that come in so hard theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll crack your sheetrock and go out so smooth theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll caulk it back up. Good for\noutdoor listening, I suppose.\n\nTonally similar to ZoroasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dog Magicand mixed so the thick, hairy (which would have to be the next step up from fuzzy, right?) guitars and bass are primary considerations when listening, the sample-laden Alpha demonstrates its creatorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ thoughtfulness in a variety of ways apart from the ease of transitions.\nAll six tracks begin with the same letter as the album title, for example, and the songs are arranged so that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Bomb a Nation,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the longest of the bunch, comes at the end of the vinylÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side A. These may\nbe small touches, but they show Ketea are putting real thought into their work, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re passionate about it, where many bands just record songs, throw them together and call it a record.\n\nWhat Alpha does exceedingly well is pull the listener into it and shove them out again. The trio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitarist/vocalist Emily, bassist/vocalist Lonnie and drummer Trey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ immediately set about modal deconstruction with opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlchemystery,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which begins with Acid King-s t y l e (if less\nconfident) clean vocals from Emily before smashing LonnieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s screams into the eardrum at 6:12. The interlude following the solo at 4:29 that leads into that segment helps set the range and overall mood of the record.\n\nThe more bass-driven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAffect the HiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the shortest and maybe the screamiest of the songs, with high-low growls and cackles playing off each other over a punishing guitar line, and the\naforementioned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Bomb a Nation,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds EmilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals more present in the mix, better sounding for it and accompanied by some Mastodonish rhythmic screaming. Side A ends quietly and side B, like the album itself, starts with a sample in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œApochrypha.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The more droned-out riffing, Kylesa-esque simultaneous vocal attack from Emily and Lonnie, insistent drumming from Trey and accordingly careful timing in the guitar provides further evidence that KeteaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach is well but not\noverly considered. They sound like their songwriting is a priority, but also that it is unforced.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAndromedaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the most sample-heavy of the songs, with some screams thrown in to keep things moving. What the samples are talking about IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re partially\nburied under the music, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bit about the Kraken, which isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t surprising given the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beast-of-the-sea moniker (the Cetea were water-bound monsters in Greek mythology). Closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAbove AllÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ may not be the longest track on Alpha, but it is imbued with a sense of totality, be it because of the title or the massiveness of the riff around which it is centered and revolving. A longer interlude with dreamy guitar noises and echoes (cut off at 3:09) underscores once again that KeteaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strength is in being able to switch between all-out brown note doom and quieter moments. The memorable guitar line soon\nmakes its exit into about a two-minute feedback outro.\n\nThere are times when listening to Alpha feels like being picked up and put back down, but the organic sound of the band and the decided lack of awkwardness in their switching from one to the other is enough to make them stand out among their doomed peers in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crowded scene. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re worth watching to see what they do down the line, but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let that stop you from missing them now\neither.

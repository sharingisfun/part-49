After explaining the basics of code generation, we will focus on &quot;problematic&quot; instructions, and point to possible ways to exploit stuff.\n\nA short introduction into just-in-time compiler techniques is given: Why JIT, about compiler invocation, runtime code modification using signals, codegeneration. Then theoretical attack vectors are elaborated: language bugs, intermediate representation quirks and assembler instruction inadequacies. With these considerations in mind the results of a CACAO code review are presented. For each vulnerability possible exploits are discussed and two realized exploits are demonstrated.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ad79a6e6e099469cd8fdc1a3ce7b49fbdfe9ef","amp;dn":"24c3-2247-en-breaking_a_vm.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ad79a6e6e099469cd8fdc1a3ce7b49fbdfe9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,173,121,166,230,224,153,70,156,216,253,193,163,206,123,73,251,223,233,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The diclonius have horns and strong telekinetic powers represented by &quot;arms&quot;. However with this great power, they can easily destroy the human race. Fearful of their power, humans quarantined the diclonius into secret research facilities to study. However, in a freak accident, a enraged female diclonius escaped, killing many guards in the process.

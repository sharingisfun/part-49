Date: 2007-12-29 \nGenre: Death Metal \nLabel: Last Entertainment Productions \nSource: CD \nType: Mini CD \nEncoder: LAME v3.97 -V2 --vbr-new \nQuality: VBR, 44.1kHz, Joint Stereo \n\nIs this a side-project or a full-blown band? For \nnow I will go with the full-blown band option \nsince Flagellation was formed in 1997 and released \na 3-track promo in 1998 only to fall into \nhibernation for a couple of years after a couple \nof live gigs. In 2004/2005 the band awoke from \ntheir long sleep. \nIncinerate Disintegrate has now officially been \nreleased by Last Entertainment Productions after \nhaving been available as download on \nFlagellation's website. Finally, I would say, \nsince Incinerate Disintegrate is a great little \nslab of death metal, no flagellation of the ears \nfor me here. This sort of death metal you can wake \nme up for in the middle of the night. \nThis is the sort of music Zyklon should have \nreleased after Aeon. Yep, that's right, \nFlagellation is reminiscent of Zyklon's best works \nIncinerate Disintegrate is chockful of slightly \ntechnical almost brutal and epic death metal. In \n20 minutes six songs, of which Rendering The \nApocalypse and Vast Desolation are an intro and \noutro to the work proper, are fired onto the \nlistener. \nEvery song is full of tempo changes and chopping \nheavy riffs supported by a decent grunt and \ndriving bass and drums, and the keyboards offer, \nas keyboards should do in this sort of music, some \nvery distant atmospheric touches. To top it all of \nis a very able production Jonas Kjellgren (Scar \nSymmetry, Centinex). His production doesn't make \nit sound too mechanical he has found a nice \nbalance between mechanical and organic, as in my \nopinion should be done for this type of slightly \nmore modern death metal. \nIt is hard to pinpoint a truly standout track on \nthis mini, but weere I forced to do so I would opt \nfor Threshold To Madness which features guest \nvocals by Jonas Kjellgren and strangely enough is \nalso the song where the keyboards are most \nprominent. But the prominence of the keyboards \nwork really well here supporting the changes in \nrhythm brilliantly. \nAll in all a mini album which makes me look \nforward to a full-length release by these guy. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flagellation.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flagellation.net&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n1.

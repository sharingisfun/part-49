Camera work is OK, a little out of focus at times and closeups are a little shaky. \nThe blurriness of the footage looks like a 3rd gen VHS transfer. \n(The actual video is a little clearer than the screenshots may suggest though.) Audio is good. \nThis is the show of the so-called &quot;fence incident&quot; where the band stops the show for as long as it takes the crowd to step back a bit. \n\n\nSetlist:\nDeuce\nKing of the night time world\nLet me go, rock 'n' roll\nDo you love me?\nFirehouse\nWatchin' you\nShock me\nCalling Dr. Love\nShout it out loud\nLove gun\nCold gin\nI was made for lovin' you\nGod of thunder\nNew York groove\n100,000 years\nBlack diamond\nDetroit rock city\nBeth\nRock and roll all nite\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b6e3c1afdf08269ec8ae34902cede9a2e7eb68","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Utrecht%2CHolland+11-6-1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b6e3c1afdf08269ec8ae34902cede9a2e7eb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,182,227,193,175,223,8,38,158,200,174,52,144,44,237,233,162,231,235,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

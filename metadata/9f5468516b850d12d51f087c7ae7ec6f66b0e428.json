I recommend \n      and have used one system for years - CoreAVC for H264 \n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5910023/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5910023/&lt;/a&gt;\n      (&quot;Deblocking&quot; set to &quot;Standard&quot;) and part of DivX7-8 for AAC - \n      AAC DirectShow filter.\n\n      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p \n      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)\n      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreAVC \n      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).\n      \n      New DivX8 is maybe 18% slower than Core AVC and very common, \n      and in order to use DivX8 H264 and AAC DS filters outside DivX7 or 8 player \n      (as in Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic), Haali spliter \n      must be installed. Beware, however, that video quality could be very much\n      degraded on encodings where extremely low bit-rates have been used.\n      TIP: Switch back and forth between Core AVC and DivX H264 DS filters by marking\n      and un-marking Core AVC &quot;Preferred decoder&quot; setting.\n      \n      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following \n      and-or a combination of these:  the playback system itself, a \n      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. \n      \n      For instance, any so called &quot;jerky&quot; playback of &quot;system-heavy&quot; 720p comes\n      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded \n      computer. Use of ddshow filters and &quot;codecs&quot; is suicidal. This is not \n      Russian 720p Matroska format (&quot;official&quot; 720p) and completely different \n      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent\n      &quot;hide&quot; bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, \n      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as \n      much as possible.\n        \n      Any &quot;blurriness&quot; of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. \n      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,\n      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.\n      Any &quot;blockiness&quot; comes from &quot;system-too-slow&quot; situation, when\n       decoding engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot \n       process all frames as it supposed to.\n      On &quot;I have no video&quot; and &quot;I have no sound&quot; I don't waste my time as this \n      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. \n      RTFM is the best response I can give.\n\n      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC \n      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of \n      any kind.\n\n      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).\n      If you watch on HighDef TV or new HighRes monitor - take a proper watching\n      distance - 6 to 8 ft. (It's a must then, I KNOW how ugly it looks with nose\n      in front of screen). LCD panels, especially cheap and affordable ones \n      &quot;hate&quot; low bit-rate encodes. \n      I have two monitors connected and same encode looks ugly on\n      LG LED LCD but looks fantastic on normal CRT Samsung one. \n      So, move your bottoms few feet back - or download GB big encodes.\n      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\n      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system \n      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones \n      with Line In of any Stereo rack).\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nYou meet people who forget you. You forget people you meet. \nBut sometimes you meet those people you can't forget. Those are your friends.\n\n------------------\n\nPlease be aware that the download manager called Flashget, Transmission under v1.9, Xtorrent (any), generally malfunctioning Miro/libtorrent, uTorrent lower than 1.8.3, Azureus/Vuze under v4, KTorrent, BitLord and ANY other &quot;wrong&quot; or hacked/patched/&quot;tweaked&quot;/&quot;with-wrong-settings&quot; torrent-program - can and WILL  get you blocked by me.\n\nI will not be re enabling people if they have been using ANY of the above applications; there is NO discussion on this. Please treat this as the ONLY warning you will get about it!\n\nIf you have used it, do yourself a favour and get a NEW and proper torrent program.\nIn light of recent events, I have no intention to discuss or listen to someone's comments/complaints such as Oh, but I am used to it. or I have this-or-that settings, this is good program for torrents.\n\nIt might be true for you, but that's not what I see day after day.\nRecommended torrent applications are: BitTornado and new uTorrent/BitTorrent!!!\n\nAlso, stay AWAY from newly upped torrents, still in the phase of initial-seeding IF you have upload speed below 50kB/s and CANNOT or WILL NOT set UL/DL speeds at 1:1.\nWait until at LEAST five (5) stable seeds are present.\nIf you have a problem with my initial-seeding rule then go elsewhere to source your files.\n\nYou have been warned, my torrents therefore my rules. There are a million other sources to go to if you do not like them.\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nRULE:     Torrent that gets &quot;-&quot; (minus) is on the way out. TPB should remove that \n          relict as playground for lunatics (not just my torrents get &quot;minuses&quot;\n          from idiots who cannot get hard otherwise). \n          'Comments' are there for voicing opinion out.\n          Let me be clear: 480p is BETTER than XviD: half in file-size,\n          but quality is not half of XviD, right?. \n          480p has BIGGER frame-size (&quot;picture&quot; size) than 272p MORE THAN TWICE \n          (2.16 times) - but file-size is bigger just by silly 10% (15 MB approx.).\n          Also, 480p has by ONE THIRD BIGGER frame-size than XviD.\n          So - new rule: any complaints came from your head only.\n          IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - \n          vent someplace else out. My files are perfect - in given category.\n          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. \n          Forever.\n          SUB-RULE: Normal people! Do not let be over-runned by idiots! Not again-\n          Do not allow to be over-voiced. Again.\n          IF you like my encodings, you CAN say so - by Rating and by Thanking.\n          \n          And yes - it is matter of vanity. That's me.

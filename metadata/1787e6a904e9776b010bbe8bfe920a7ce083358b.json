Each side has 8 classes including a builder class that is able to set up base defences and team spawn points. Every time you kill an enemy you get frags to \\'spend\\' on a better class. Spider classes range from the lowly 20 health but deadly hatchling to the monolithic stalker that obliterates everything it its path. Humans start out as a grunt and can work their way up to a mechanized unit with dual autocannons. Gloom features all-custom models, maps, sounds and gameplay. This won\\'t feel like the Quake II you are used to.\n\ntl;dr awesome fast paced FPS game that\\'s more than mindless point and shoot but uses strategy.  Let\\'s get some good 40 player games going again!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1787e6a904e9776b010bbe8bfe920a7ce083358b","amp;dn":"Quake2%2Bgloom-Standalone%2Bmappack-12-30-2010.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1787e6a904e9776b010bbe8bfe920a7ce083358b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,135,230,169,4,233,119,107,1,11,190,139,254,146,10,124,224,131,53,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Along with the rest of the Wildcats, they stage a spring musical to address their experiences, hopes and fears about their future.\n\n[NOTES]: Right this is a re-encode of coalitions release which isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t too bad at all. The video they used was pleaders which has been out for some time but never used due to a lack of some decent audio.The video quality is not to bad, is on the dull side and lacks color. Also is heavily cropped at the bottom and not the sharpest they done. Audio pretty good by todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standards, so well done.\n\n[WORK DONE]: The main thing was to brighten this up and give it some color so there was a big increase in the chroma, gamma and lum. Also then needed to equal it out with the contrast and make the black look more like black instead of grey. After doing the but I then needed to lower the rgb black base to remove the bright parts. Finally I used a video noise reduction filter and a contour filter on a very high setting to try and help sharpen it up a touch and the video noise reduction was just used slightly. Overall 7.5 all round IMO.\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-4400.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-4400.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-3708.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-3708.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-3969.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-3969.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-6974.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/HSM3/vlcsnap-6974.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b54fd499f178376314958b6176caef8a0f9448ab","amp;dn":"High+School+Musical+3+Senior+Year+TS+XVID+-+STG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b54fd499f178376314958b6176caef8a0f9448ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,79,212,153,241,120,55,99,20,149,139,97,118,202,239,138,15,148,72,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin, a schlemiel&amp;#039;s schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time, Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately, the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior, in honor of Seymour&amp;#039;s girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks, or rather, commands: &quot;Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!&quot; Before long, the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective, a sadistic dentist, and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile, Mr. Mushnik, who has stumbled onto Seymour&amp;#039;s secret, has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith, who also wrote the script and supplied the plant&amp;#039;s voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious, ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms, the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release, Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s.\n\nDirector:Roger Corman\nCast:Jonathan Haze--Jackie Joseph--Mel Wells--Jack Nicholson\n72 Min.\nB/N\nPAL.\n\n+Information in: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdquorum.es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdquorum.es&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae17518a14e652a91b204d0b0c3f903e67ee2416","amp;dn":"The+Little+Shop+of+Horrors+1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae17518a14e652a91b204d0b0c3f903e67ee2416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,23,81,138,20,230,82,169,27,32,77,11,12,63,144,62,103,238,36,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

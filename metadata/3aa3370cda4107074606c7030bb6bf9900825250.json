The two plan to wed, but their families object to an interfaith marriage. And when Marian becomes pregnant, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell Ben. Coerced by Father Brennan (a Catholic priest who is also her uncle), Marian goes to Castleboro Mother Baby Home, an institution ruled by Sister Paulinas and Sister Agnes where Ã¢â‚¬Å“sins are purgedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ via abuse; i.e., pregnant girls are forced to mow the lawn by pulling grass on their hands and knees. \n\nMarian is told that her son, Adrian, will be adopted by an American family. The riveting storyline provides many surprises as it fast-forwards to 1967 where Marian and Ben are married and have a 10-year-old daughter. MarianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painful secret emerges when she learns that her son was dumped in an abusive orphanage not far from her middle-class home and Sister Agnes is his legal guardian. Thus begins a labyrinthine journey through red tape as the couple fight to regain their firstborn child. \n\nUltimately, 12-year-old Adrian is placed in the Surtane Industrial School for Boys, which is rife with brutality and sexual abuse at the hands of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christian Brother Ryder.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Though unchecked church power abounds, this is not a religious stereotype or an indictment of faith. Hateful characters like Brother Ryder are balanced with compassionate ones, such as a timid nurse from the Mother Baby Home. Father Brennan deepens into a three-dimensional character who struggles to do what is right. \n\nHenry weaves multilayered themes of prejudice, corruption and redemption with an authentic voice and swift, seamless dialogue. Her prose is engaging, and light poetic touches add immediacy. For example, when Marian returned to Mother Baby Home after 11 years, she Ã¢â‚¬Å“opened the car door and stepped onto the gravel, wanting to quiet its crunch, like skeletons underneath her shoes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Echoing the painful lessons of the Jewish Holocaust, HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale reveals what happens when good people remain silent.\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa3370cda4107074606c7030bb6bf9900825250","amp;dn":"The+Whipping+Club+by+Deborah+Henry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa3370cda4107074606c7030bb6bf9900825250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,163,55,12,218,65,7,7,70,6,199,3,11,182,191,153,0,130,82,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But it will be relevant to the moral deliberation\nof anyone who thinks consequences are morally significant. It is best understood\nas an argument about decision making under conditions of uncertainty. An actor\nin possession of perfect information would know, of course, which meat purchases\nwould and which would not cause harm to actual animals. If she were a\nconsequentialist, she could use this information to perform the needed utility calculations and decide confidently how to proceed. The threshold argument is\ndesigned, in effect, to persuade someone with very limited information that she\nshould avoid purchasing meat. The argument focuses on a putatively inverse relationship between the odds that a given purchase will trigger a threshold crossing and the number of animals likely to be affected by such a crossing. It seeks to show that, in light of this relationship, the actor with perfect information, who knows that her meat purchase will result in harm to a single animal, and the actor with very imperfect information, who knows that her purchase might harm many animals or none, are in morally equivalent positions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0630f44be42bd08573863c26d14345567fb93982","amp;dn":"On+the+Threshold+Argument+against+Consumer+Meat+Purchases+-+Arti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0630f44be42bd08573863c26d14345567fb93982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,48,244,75,228,43,208,133,115,134,60,38,209,67,69,86,127,185,57,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

His musical style is characterized by his recognizable vocals and catchy melodies, and his numerous MTV music videos throughout the 1980s.\n\nMoney returned to the mainstream rock spotlight with the album Can&amp;#039;t Hold Back, which featured a Ronnie Spector duet with &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, which reached the Top 10, along with the hit &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot;. Money followed the album with another Top 10 hit &quot;Walk on Water&quot;, but his Top 40 career ended by the early 1990s when &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Get By&quot; charted. During the 1990s and 2000s, Money continued to release numerous compilation albums along with several albums featuring new material. Today, he still tours the &quot;Oldies&quot; circuit regularly, often accompanied by other successful rock acts from his era, and has also made several television appearances on American sitcoms.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7915da87f80a5146242d3081b1d43a5002ed353a","amp;dn":"Eddie+Money+-+Walk+On+Water","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7915da87f80a5146242d3081b1d43a5002ed353a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,21,218,135,248,10,81,70,36,45,48,129,177,212,58,80,2,237,53,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

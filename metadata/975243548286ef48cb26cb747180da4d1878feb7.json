Its low cost, superior graphics, high quality sound \n and a massive 64 KB of RAM positioned it as the winner in the home computer \n  wars, knocking out competitors from the likes of Atari, Texas Instruments, \nSinclair, Apple and IBM. Selling over 30 million units and introducing a whole \n  generation to computers and programming, the C64 shook up the video games \n    industry and sparked cultural phenomena such as computer music and the \n     demoscene. In recent years the C64 has enjoyed a spectacular revival \n         manifesting itself once again as a retrocomputing platform. \n     \n     \n  To allow you to experience and relive the wonders of this unique computer, \n     Cloanto, developers of Commodore/Amiga software since the 1980s, has \nintroduced C64 Forever, a revolutionary C64 emulator, preservation and support \n   package. C64 Forever embodies an intuitive player interface, backed by a \n built-in database containing more than 5,000 C64 game entries, and advanced \n        support for the new RP9 format, dubbed the &quot;MP3 of retrogaming \n     \n     \nC64 Forever shares the same RetroPlatform family player, database and content \nmanagement components as the very successful Amiga Forever series. As such, it \nalso embodies more than 12 years of experience and refinements and a tradition \n             of innovation and long-term continuity and support. \n     \nCompared to other solutions for different systems, C64 Forever stands out for \n                    features which include the following: \n     \n    Smooth setup: it takes only a few mouse clicks to install and run (no \n                        additional downloads required) \n     \n   Intuitive, simple and refined user interface, in which player, content, \ndatabase and search are seamlessly integrated (not a &quot;front end&quot; that launches \n                            an external emulator) \n     \n Built-in RetroPlatform Library database featuring thousands of titles, with \n                                online updates \n     \n As some projects kept adding options year after year, C64 Forever strived to \n  keep options to a minimum, as RetroPlatform components take sophisticated \n                         decisions behind the scenes \n     \n   If you know how to use Amiga Forever you are instantly familiar with C64 \n                           Forever, and vice versa \n     \n Support for revolutionary RP9 format (one click to play, one file per title, \n     no need to zip or unzip games or manage multiple disk images, etc.) \n     \nSupport and recognition of other popular disk, tape, cartridge and save state \n formats, with options to identify uncataloged similar variants (not a simple \n                             &quot;checksum&quot; approach) \n     \n    Built-in search-as-you-type for installed content and custom one-click \n             internet search for games and demoscene productions \n     \n                    Tested on Windows 7 (both x86 and x64) \n     \n\n\n\n            \n                                                        \n                          1) Unzip, Unrar and install \n                                    \n                          2) Register with serial:  \n                                    \n                             37800-94522-53687-75205 \n                                    \n                          3) Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:975243548286ef48cb26cb747180da4d1878feb7","amp;dn":"Cloanto.C64.Forever.Plus.Edition.v2009.1.0.0-ArCADE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"975243548286ef48cb26cb747180da4d1878feb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,82,67,84,130,134,239,72,203,38,203,116,113,128,218,77,24,120,254,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In the dead of night, on a dark, lonely street in Melbourne, a cabby discovers that his drunken passenger has been murdered--suffocated with a chloroform saturated handkerchief. The murderer, his motive, even the identity of the victim are unknown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5325a8bebf4da8d42da532ccdfb09ee78db5136","amp;dn":"The+Mystery+of+a+Hansom+Cab+-+Fergus+Hume.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5325a8bebf4da8d42da532ccdfb09ee78db5136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,50,90,139,235,244,218,141,66,218,83,44,205,251,9,238,120,219,81,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

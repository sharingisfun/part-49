A mix of many styles and genres, all these bands are performing their idea of the blues or music influenced by the blues.  Purists may not agree.  We aren't out to argue with anyone, just trying to spread the word about music we enjoy.  We call it the Deep Blues.\n\nCommerical Release warning!  A festival compilation may be released by Alive Records of the 46 festival performers.  We hope it does.  This was an open taping event.\n\nTrack 15 is unknown.   If you know otherwise then let us know.\n'Cause some of you lot were probably there!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6ed80a865f36da1b0a7ea073a712e973b67013","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Richard+Johnston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6ed80a865f36da1b0a7ea073a712e973b67013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,110,216,10,134,95,54,218,27,10,126,160,115,167,18,233,115,182,112,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

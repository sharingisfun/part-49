Finance! Scandal!\n\nMax Keiser and co-host, Stacy Herbert, look at the scandals of silver shortages and quitting the dollar. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Paul Mladjenovic, author of Precious Metals for Dummies, about silver market manipulation.\n\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.\n\nI am including the video in the torrent this time, but if you would rather not download that file, you can watch the video online at:\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n \n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

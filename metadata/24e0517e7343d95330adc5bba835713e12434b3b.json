Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi, Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger. Despite ValentinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cynical disposition and his resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another.\n\n[NOTES]: For this release I have used the Russian TS video, which was really good for such an early release. The video didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need too much doing to,main problem was too many glares and a touch of video noise. For the audio KingBen sent me audio file, now got to be honest and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cleaned up version of cameraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s audio which to be honest yet again was pretty good for a cam once cleaned up. Reason I think this was the fact that both audio files started at the same place and had the same runtime, if IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m wrong then hands up ;-) (Also KingBen wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have known this he was sent the file and was told it was a new source ). Anyway the audio was good, bit too loud and made some distortion now and again because if this but otherwise pretty good.\n\n[WORK DONE]: First thing was to get the video sorted so I ran it through my normal filters. I increased the lum and gamma slightly, then added a lot more contrast to equal it out.Also increase the color by increasing the chroma. After I needed to reduce the glares so I lowered the rgb black base to tone all glares down. To reduce the video noise I used a video noise reduction filter and then sharpened it up some more with a contour filter. Only left one other problem on the video, then noticed a couple of times through the film the cam drops down and it leaves a black line across the top of the screen. So I cropped to the lowest point and left it like that throughout the film  hence the different res on my release compared to the others. Original 704ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€288 mine 704ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€274. Now the hard part: syncing  :lol: Firstly I re-encoded the audio file in adobe audition, ran a hiss removal filter and then changed the EQ on it. Sounds better to me, but each to their own. After I needed to shrink the audio file in sony sound forge to match the runtime of the video and then it was a case of finding the first setting (audio correction) and syncing it from there. Needed to make several cuts where it went out of sync again but got there in the end. Oh and YES THERE IS NO SUBS FOR THIS. Before people start asking or moaning ;-)\n\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-497708.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-497708.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-500264.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-500264.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-502349.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-502349.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-502699.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/trans%203/vlcsnap-502699.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e0517e7343d95330adc5bba835713e12434b3b","amp;dn":"Transporter+3+TS+XVID+-+STG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e0517e7343d95330adc5bba835713e12434b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,224,81,126,115,67,217,83,48,173,197,187,168,53,113,62,18,67,75,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

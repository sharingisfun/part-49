All materials were sourced from Karyuudo Fansubs's DVD release, which was a\nfan-sub of the 2004 reissue of Transformers Zone.  All of the audio was converted\nfrom PCM to AC3, to get everything to fit on to one DVD.\n\nThe first version has DVD selectable on/off subs, and is a re-release of Karyuudo's\nwork.  Besides the audio, nothing was changed.\n\nThe second version has permanent hard-coded subs set into the video.  This is a DVD\nquality version of my previous XViD release, and is NOT simply an XViD to DVD encode.  The subs were set into the video by converting Karyuudo's DVD to uncompressed video (30GB!), and then re-converting to DVD format.  This was done to keep the maximum amount of quality during the hard-subbing, rather than down-sample to a lossy format (XViD), and then up-sample to DVD.\n\nAll of the extras were sourced from Karyuudo's DVD.  Besides the audio, nothing was\nchanged.\n\n\nBackground:\nOriginally intended to be a full TV series, Transformers: Zone was forced to become a direct-to-video (OVA) due to less than expected toy sales. Although rumors have always circulated that as many as five could have been completed, only this first episode was released, and serves as the final animated installment of the Japanese Generation 1 cartoon.\n\n\nPlot:\nFollowing on from Transformers: Victory, the mysterious three-faced insectoid being, Violenjiger dispatches the nine &quot;Great Decepticon Generals&quot; - Devastator, Menasor, Bruticus, Trypticon, Predaking, Abominus, King Poseidon, Overlord and BlackZarak - to acquire &quot;Zone Energy,&quot; destroying the planet Feminia to obtain the world's store.  Caught in the destruction of the planet, Star Saber is rescued by Dai Atlas, who then repels an attack by the Decepticons, and is appointed the new Autobot commander at the conclusion of the episode.\n\n\nThanks:\nKaryuudo Fansubs deserves a lot of credit for this release.  Without their DVD source, translating, timing, and subbing, this would not have been possible.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://karyuudofansubs.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://karyuudofansubs.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3427491/Zone_DVD_(eng_subs)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3427491/Zone_DVD_(eng_subs)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918cca2dce03aa67e576835f0564ddf1e503fa29","amp;dn":"Transformers.Zone.1990.DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918cca2dce03aa67e576835f0564ddf1e503fa29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,140,202,45,206,3,170,103,229,118,131,95,5,100,221,241,229,3,250,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Evan is a bright young student whose outward sweetness belies his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his lifelong best friend Seth -- a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school as Evan. But Evan and Seth both know that college is a place of personal reinvention, and that if they are able to make that first leap together they will have forged a bond powerful enough to last a lifetime. Meanwhile, Evan and Seth's friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquires a hastily rendered fake I.D. that instantly endears him to a pair of truly irresponsible cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen). Penned by co-star Rogen in collaboration with former Da Ali G Show co-writer Evan Goldberg, the semi-autobiographical SuperBad was produced by Judd Apatow and directed by Greg Mottola -- who previously helmed episodes of Undeclared and Arrested Development. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 58 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 109kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924ce7cc9b8355ea670406c0168c549a8221c67f","amp;dn":"Superbad%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924ce7cc9b8355ea670406c0168c549a8221c67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,76,231,204,155,131,85,234,103,4,6,192,22,140,84,154,130,33,198,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

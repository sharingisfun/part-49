That is a famous lake in Bavaria. We were already so high in the air that serious haze made the image flat. It?s the one at the bottom of the image in this post.\n\nIn this episode I show how to get rid of the haze by using the curves or levels tool. And of course I have a way using layers. A layer copy in burn mode takes a lot of the haze away. Further fine tuning involves a layer mask and an overlay layer copy.\n\nI couldn?t record in Croatia, somehow we never got a recording with sound and video. If I am invited to another such event, I?ll buy a strong enough notebook and test the setup before the trip. But aside from this it was fun and I met a lot of interesting people, most of them connected with the Croatian Linux Group ?HULK?.

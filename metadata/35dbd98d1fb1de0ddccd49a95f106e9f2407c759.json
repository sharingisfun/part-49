Half man, half ape, the yeti is said to roam only    \n         the most remote peaks, where people rarely venture. Now,      \n         veteran explorer and climber Gerry Moffatt sets out to find   \n         proof in a hunt that will test his stamina. As conventional   \n         scientific theories challenge ancient beliefs and credible    \n         witnesses, he works to separate fact from fiction and find    \n          hard evidence that the legend is real.                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.

Sometimes also \n\nthey're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If \n\nnot \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the \n\ncrack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test \n\nthem:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check \n\nfirst \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their \n\nvirus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will \n\nallow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be \n\nset \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a \n\npc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short \n\ntime \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE \n\ncomments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously \n\nreply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from \n\nTPB!\n\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- avast! Pro Antivirus\n3- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false \n\npositives!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally \n\nposting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about \n\npeople \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer \n\nagainst \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up \n\nfor \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an \n\napp \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; \n\nposted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at February 25 2011 - 01.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease share....Don't hit and run...Seed it back at least once.\n\nOf course, if you want to seed it back more than once, that would be ok too \n\n:)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57ca0e4547a56c6c80142bac27eb905bb3b4ee3","amp;dn":"Fringe+SO3E15+Subject+13+HDTV+XviD+-+sot5Mc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c57ca0e4547a56c6c80142bac27eb905bb3b4ee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,124,160,228,84,122,86,198,200,1,66,186,194,126,185,5,187,59,78,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Resizing, compressing to crappy quality to get under 700 MB (this is 2009--who is still using CDs to back up movies?), and generally leaving out most of the original DVD's functionality.\n\nI think we should have something better, and so I present this first BDR (Better DVD Rip). My goal is to give as close to watching the main feature (if the demand is high enough, I may separately encode and include special feature portions in the future) on a DVD as possible, without simply making an image out of the DVD itself, which isn't bad, but is inefficient.\n\nThe movie this time is the Jet Li hit, Hero. Here are the stats pulled from the included readme.txt:\n\nVideo: 716x366 (no resizing, just cropping black bars)\nCodec: x264\nContainer: Matroska (.mkv)\nAudio: Chinese, English, French (all AC3 1:1 copies from DVD)\nSubs: English\nChapters: Yes (identical to original DVD)\n\nI'm looking for feedback, so let me know what you think.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45847d9dbe0cb49cf04712e4b382908b71db9272","amp;dn":"Hero+%28BDR%3A+triple+audio%2C+subtitles%2C+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45847d9dbe0cb49cf04712e4b382908b71db9272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,132,125,157,190,12,180,156,240,71,18,228,179,130,144,139,113,219,146,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I\\&amp;#039;ve rebuild the shell32, cause Flyakite 3.5 screwed the shell32 of Servicepack 3 !! There are several tweaks, but I\\&amp;#039;ve kept all main functions. Only the real useless things like windows tour I\\&amp;#039;ve left out this installation. The only thing that\\&amp;#039;s not working for me, is an installation into Mac Parallels.. (don\\&amp;#039;t know why..I\\&amp;#039;ve tried several versions) but gives an error at beginning of installation. I haven\\&amp;#039;t tried it in VM Ware Fusion, cause this application never worked on my hackingtosh.. But it worked fine in WM Ware Workstation in XP. So I think it\\&amp;#039;s working fine to on VM Ware fusion, but I don\\&amp;#039;t know for sure.. leave a reply when someone have tried this !\n\nIt\\&amp;#039;s configured for Multi-Processor systems with 1GB or more RAM, but\\&amp;#039;s working fine too on older PC\\&amp;#039;s. On my system it\\&amp;#039;s running like hell !! the only thing left to do after installation is to disable the prefetch funtion, (this makes booting XP very long) with WinXP manager it\\&amp;#039;s easy to fix this. (it\\&amp;#039;s included in this installation) after disabling prefetch it\\&amp;#039;s boots in 5 seconds, after 7 seconds you\\&amp;#039;re logged in as Administrator ! (Pentium 4 with 1GB RAM)\nThe default theme is Panther/Tiger theme (brushed) and I\\&amp;#039;ve included 32-bit high resolution ico\\&amp;#039;s too !! (system32 folder)\n\nHave fun !!\n\nProtocolX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0202a6f4e86d27d13bc9eb90d86c58cba792e37e","amp;dn":"OSXP%3F+LiTe+SP3+%5Bfinal%5D.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0202a6f4e86d27d13bc9eb90d86c58cba792e37e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,2,166,244,232,109,39,209,59,201,235,144,216,108,88,203,167,146,227,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It&amp;#039;s updated to include transfers upto and including 8/8/8.\n\nIt should be quicker to download than my other files, but though I have done as many transfers as I can, I am not the Rothmans Football Yearbook 2008!\n\nIf you like this please check out my other downloads for player pictures and background screens for FM08, which are for your serious Champ addicts, they take much longer to download though!\n\nThe original folder was taken from the 8.02 update and I have changed and amended since the January transfer window. You need to update your FM08 with 8.02 exe for this to work, you can get this from here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sigames.com/news.php?type=view&amp;article_id=1297&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sigames.com/news.php?type=view&amp;article_id=1297&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPut this folder in your &amp;#039;my documents/sports interactive/database&amp;#039; folder and then when starting a new game select moskollo db.\n\n\nPeace and long live torrent,\n\n\n\n\nMoskollo\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f5c1beed37c4a9ac41941111b8aa5920ff7e98","amp;dn":"Moskollo+FM08+DB+Updated+to+8%2F8%2F8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f5c1beed37c4a9ac41941111b8aa5920ff7e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,245,193,190,237,55,196,169,172,65,148,17,17,184,170,89,32,255,126,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is an eight-part Canadian original drama mini-series about the life and death struggle to enforce a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in the fictional, Sarajevo-like town of Jadac.\n\nUnarmed military observers try to defuse crises and maintain the fragile ceasefire between the Christians and Muslims. They move between the rival factions, facing distrust and dangerous situations. Even the armed U.N. soldiers that have arrived in town to maintain order by any means necessary are not entirely on their side. The series details the dangers and apparent futilities of living in a violent peacekeeping zone, as well as the psychological and physical costs to the peacekeepers who attempt to remain neutral.\n\nMichelle Nolden as Sean Kuzak \nColm Meaney as George Titac \nLolita Davidovich as Mila Michailov \nRick Roberts as Maj. Gavin Hart \nEnrico Colantoni as Speedo Boy \nAllan Hawco as Capt.

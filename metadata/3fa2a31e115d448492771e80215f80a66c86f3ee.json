Some of these guys have previously been a member of bands like, Infernal Death, Epicenter, Panzerchrist and Frozen Sun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fa2a31e115d448492771e80215f80a66c86f3ee","amp;dn":"CHAINFIST+-+Black+Out+Sunday+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fa2a31e115d448492771e80215f80a66c86f3ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,162,163,30,17,93,68,132,146,119,30,128,33,95,128,166,108,134,243,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is a diary for everything you eat, as well as your sports activities and by calculating your nutritional requirements, it will help you not simply eat less of something but eat the right amount.\n\nFoodurama isn't tailored to any specific diet which often try to give your body too little of either fat, carbon hydrates or proteins. Foodurama will instead help you become aware of what you eat and how often you're actually involved in sports. See when you've had enough fat for the day and have Foodurama suggest foods and beverages that best complement what you've had all day.\n\nIf your doctor prescribes going below or above the usual limit for a specific nutrient, Foodurama is easily set up to factor in your temporary needs. You can easily record your weight each day and analyze it in comparison to your sports activities and the intake of one or several nutrients.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Eat a more balanced diet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Get to know a greater selection of foods / dishes\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Profit from a database of over 7,000 different foods to pick from\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Enter your own food, including their nutrient values\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Plan ahead for the day\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â  Record your daily sports routine and have Foodurama automatically adjust your requirements\n\nInstructions.\n\n1.

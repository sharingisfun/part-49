All in PDF, sorted according to composer.\n\nThis is a very nice collection of Danish classical music I found a while ago on the net. And since it seems to be available only on private trackers, I decided to make a public torrent of it. There are 48 composers represented, which makes this torrent an interesting view into what the Danish music scene might have looked like in the end of the 19th century.\n\nSome of the files were corrupt, which is why some of the numbered works misses a piece. I think have deleted all the files that are corrupt, but there might be some left. I have also added my own collection of music for these composers in the cases I had additional sheets.\n\n[It's not as neatly sorted as usually, but I uploaded it in a hurry. Sorry 'bout that]\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRepresented composers:\n\nAmberg, Johan\n\nBarth, Christian Frederik\nBecker, Georg\nBerggreen, Andreas Peter\nBergh, Rudolph\nBlom, Friedrich Anthon\nBohlmann, Georg Carl\nBraun, Carl Anton Philipp\nBruun de Neergaard, Joachim\n\nDam, M. G\n\nFrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸hlich, Johannes Frederik\n\nGade, Niels Wilhelm\n\nHalvorsen, Johan\nHansen, Thorvald\nHartmann, Emil (Wilhelm Emilius Zinn)\nHartmann, J.P.E.

By the way,\nthe same goes for Norwegian too. But in addition they\nhave the letter ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ for Aa &amp; aa.\n\nSwedish letters are\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ for Aa &amp; aa | ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ for Ae &amp; ae | ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ for Oe &amp; oe. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNB! Since my connection is rather slow, please be patient.\nI will have to turn off my computer for the night (CET)\nand I need you to help me seed upon completion!\n\nIf I suddenly stop seeding, just wait and I'll continue to seed \nas soon as I can. I'm moving and my connection will be broken \nfor a while.\n\nThanks :)\n\nLakritslemmel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faff590d17319818e1adcb3ed0f704c8cb0a2134","amp;dn":"Sheet+Music%3A+Danish+composers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faff590d17319818e1adcb3ed0f704c8cb0a2134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,255,89,13,23,49,152,24,225,173,203,62,208,247,4,200,203,10,33,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

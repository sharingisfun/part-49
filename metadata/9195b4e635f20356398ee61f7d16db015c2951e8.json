Tintin sets off to South America to retrieve a stolen fetish. There, all sorts of interests are in conflict: military, economic and the war of the Gran Chaco which had been opposing Bolivia and Paraguay for the past three years.\n\nA small Arumbaya statue has been stolen in a museum, then returned. One little detail though will tell Tintin that instead of the original, a mere replica was returned. There must be a secret hiding behind this small statue since its robbery was carefully concealed. This is in South America that Tintin will find the key to this enigma.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/75/tintinbrokenear.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/75/tintinbrokenear.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nenjoi,\n\nsani\n\n\nBTW - this was ripped from a DVD but it looks like VHS :-/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9195b4e635f20356398ee61f7d16db015c2951e8","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Tintin+-+The+Broken+Ear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9195b4e635f20356398ee61f7d16db015c2951e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,149,180,230,53,242,3,86,57,142,230,31,125,22,219,1,92,41,81,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

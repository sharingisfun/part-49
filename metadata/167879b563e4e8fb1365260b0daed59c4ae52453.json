The Days That Shaped Me marks the first time the siblings have recorded music together, a union prompted by a 2007 tribute concert to their mother. Having appeared on stage together, the pair soon found themselves penning a swathe of new music together. It seems they had no trouble attracting other folk luminaries to join them on the record: Kathryn Williams co-wrote ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Father UsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Secret SmileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and sings harmonies on both (Marry previously sang on KathrynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lal-inspired ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Winter Is SharpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Quickening); James Yorkston co-wrote and duets on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Yolk Yellow LeggedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢; Eliza Carthy sings lead on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Loosened ArrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and plays fiddle on a couple of tracks; and Reuben TaylorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s piano is used to great effect on tracks like the McGarrigle-esque ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Run To Catch A KissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/20/marry-waterson-and-oliver-knight/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/20/marry-waterson-and-oliver-knight/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167879b563e4e8fb1365260b0daed59c4ae52453","amp;dn":"Marry+Waterson+%26+Oliver+Knight+...The+Days+That+Shaped+Me%282011%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167879b563e4e8fb1365260b0daed59c4ae52453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,120,121,181,99,228,232,251,19,101,38,11,13,174,213,156,74,229,36,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

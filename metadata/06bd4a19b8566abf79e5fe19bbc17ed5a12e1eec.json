It was filmed and first screened in 1996 and released along with select prints of the film Stephen King's THINNER. It was released a year later internationally on VHS.\n\nThe film tells the story of a scary Maestro with supernatural powers, who is being forced out of a small town by its mayor. The movie includes a series of dance routines performed by Michael Jackson and his &quot;family&quot; of ghouls. Every song from the film was taken from Michael Jackson's HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor albums. The film is also notable for an early film appearance of rapper Mos Def.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06bd4a19b8566abf79e5fe19bbc17ed5a12e1eec","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Ghosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06bd4a19b8566abf79e5fe19bbc17ed5a12e1eec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,189,74,25,184,86,106,191,121,229,254,25,187,193,126,213,161,46,30,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

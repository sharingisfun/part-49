Like the rest of the Sullivan series, it&amp;#039;s essentially a collector&amp;#039;s item; the performances are spirited, deviate little from the records except that the arrangements are usually thinner, and are exceedingly short (over half the cuts clock in at under two minutes). The Buddy Holly songs are the most valuable, especially considering that barely any live recordings of him survive. The Jerry Lee Lewis medley, incidentally, is from 1969, not the &amp;#039;50s.

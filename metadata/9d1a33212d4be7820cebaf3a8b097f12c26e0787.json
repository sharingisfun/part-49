It is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise, and prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a KÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½lÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â« Thuggee religious cult plotting child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice.\n\nProducer and co-writer George Lucas decided to make the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains once more. The original idea was to set the film in China, with a hidden valley inhabited by dinosaurs. More cancelled plot devices included the Monkey King and a haunted castle in Scotland. Lucas then wrote a film treatment that resembled the final storyline of the film, with Lawrence Kasdan turning down the offer to write the script.\n\nWillard Huyck and Gloria Katz wrote the script, while the filmmakers were denied permission to film in North India because the government found the script racist resulting in filming to take place in Sri Lanka. Most of Temple of Doom was shot using sound stages at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Harrison Ford suffered a severe spinal disc herniation during filming. Despite other problems, Spielberg finished filming on schedule. The film was originally released with mixed reviews, and helped spawn the creation of the PG-13 rating. Nonetheless Temple of Doom was a financial success and has received generally positive feedback since 1984.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1a33212d4be7820cebaf3a8b097f12c26e0787","amp;dn":"Indiana+Jones+-+The+Temple+of+Doom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1a33212d4be7820cebaf3a8b097f12c26e0787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,26,51,33,45,75,231,130,12,235,175,58,139,9,127,18,194,110,7,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

TECHNICOLOUR MOTHER is a perfectly realized collection of neo psychedelia, with the gorgeous textures of &quot;67 Dreams&quot; conjuring the glory days of 1960s bands like Love, Spirit, and Strawberry Alarm Clock, while the mesmerizing &quot;Her Planet Is Love&quot; is an assured contemporary take on Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

Peter Gaulke (Zahn) and Fred Wolf (Allen Covert) are the energetic hosts of &quot;Strange Wilderness&quot; -- television's most unconventional nature show. When the ratings take a nosedive and they are confronted with cancellation, Peter finds himself resorting to desperate measures in order to stay on the air. Perhaps if the &quot;Strange Wilderness&quot; crew could somehow track down the most elusive creature ever to stalk the woodlands, they could keep their show on the air and go down in history as the adventurers who solved one of nature's greatest mysteries.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 24 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 688\n\nFrame Height: 288\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 109kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d3a28536e1016d795d2bdddf97812c10060f78","amp;dn":"Strange+Wilderness%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d3a28536e1016d795d2bdddf97812c10060f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,211,162,133,54,225,1,109,121,93,43,221,223,151,129,44,16,6,15,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Browne of the duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release.\n\n \n\nMoguai stated, &quot;Working with The Green Children was really an honor for me, I like what they do, their story and what they represent. MillaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s voice is absolutely outstanding, and listening to the original track was so inspiring, that I ended up making two versions of the remix. There were just too many ideas floating in my head.  Meeting them after a gig in DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sseldorf (Germany) was a pleasure, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the music that connects!&quot;\n\n \n\nThe track list includes:\n\n \n\n1.

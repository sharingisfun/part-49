After the pounding, riff-based intro 'March of the monkey', are three glowering Sludgy epics that ascend to the level of terrifying before the twenty-five minutes is up. The snarling yelps of the vocals are a journey into the savage, territorial mind of a beast, over seething layers of snare and cymbals that hiss like gases escaping from a mire.\n\nCurrent lineup\nMarco ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½lvarez (Monkeypriest #1) - Guitar &amp; vocals\nPedro RomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n (Monkeypriest #2) - Bass &amp; vocals\nJulio Moreno (Monkeypriest #4) - Drums\n\nGenre = Sludge / Doom Metal\nFormat = mp3\nBitrate = 320 kbps\nFile Size = 106.71 MB\n\nTracklist\n1.

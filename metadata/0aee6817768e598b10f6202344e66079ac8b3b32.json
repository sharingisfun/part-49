This is the first (and only) film to truly shed light on a movement that has heretofore been shrouded in darkness and rumor and obscured by inaccurate and shallow depictions. Featuring exclusive interviews and veritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© with the musicians, a wealth of rare, seldom seen footage from the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;s earliest days, Until the Light Takes Us explores every aspect of the controversial movement that has captured the attention of the world. This is the movie that gets inside the minds and hearts of black metal's musicians. The filmmakers moved to Norway, living and filming there for two years. The movie is not about them though - it's about the extraordinary people and events that make black metal unique, unforgettable, and inevitable. This is black metal as seen through the eyes of those who created it, of those who live it, of those who are at the center of the story of black metal. Featuring: Gylve &quot;Fenriz&quot; Nagell, Varg Vikernes, Jan Axel &quot;Hellhammer&quot; Blomberg, Kjetil &quot;Frost&quot; Haraldstad, Ivar Bjornson, Abbath and Demonaz Doom Occulta, Kris &quot;Garm&quot; Rygg, Bjarne Melgaard, Harmony Korine, and more. The film, shot on 35 mm and dv, is directed and produced by Audrey Ewell and Aaron Aites. It is currently being edited in New York.

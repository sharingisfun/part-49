Exploring the world of the big game hunters and the luxury of today's safaris, he goes on a personal journey to experience how the beauty of the bush made Africa the white man's playground. Using film and photographic archive, the film evokes the spirit of decadence, exploration and adventure of the safari and reveals how it continues to be a barometer of our attitudes to travel, our colonial inheritance and Africa itself.\n\nTech Spec for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 88 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.58 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from mvgroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n\nPDTV version also available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23628422bb6fa8df74aa8443e88d6158ba45dc3c","amp;dn":"BBC+The+History+of+Safari+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23628422bb6fa8df74aa8443e88d6158ba45dc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,98,132,34,187,111,168,223,116,170,132,67,232,141,97,88,186,69,220,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Most Christians know what Tracts are....In Christ Ministries has done something a little different! We&amp;#039;ve made a CD Tract! Rather than pass out paper Tracts, why not give an Audio CD Tract to someone in need of Salvation? Simply download and burn to CD and place in mall bathrooms, telephone booths and anywhere people congregate! This is a powerful CD Tract which shares the Gospel in a way which glorifies God, uplifts Jesus Christ and shows the lost how to be saved!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:331a2fbb9e874a8cfd5ecdbc74ffb9399b97feda","amp;dn":"Salvation+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"331a2fbb9e874a8cfd5ecdbc74ffb9399b97feda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,26,47,187,158,135,74,140,253,94,205,188,116,255,185,57,155,151,254,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

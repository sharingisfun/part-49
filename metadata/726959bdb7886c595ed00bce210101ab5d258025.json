As none of the girls know how to bake well, the Queen introduces Momoko Asuka into their group to aid their quest. In Doremi's daily life, Momoko also becomes her classmate, but due to living in New York for most of her life, she is unable to speak Japanese well in her normal form and is unfamiliar with Japanese culture. While Doremi and the girls patiently teach her, they are also given temporary custody of Hana-chan, who was cursed with the former witch queen's magic to hate vegetables, which are crucial to her health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726959bdb7886c595ed00bce210101ab5d258025","amp;dn":"%5BDoremi+Fansubs%5D+Motto+Ojamajo+Doremi+-+38","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726959bdb7886c595ed00bce210101ab5d258025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,105,89,189,183,136,108,89,94,208,11,206,33,1,1,171,93,37,128,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

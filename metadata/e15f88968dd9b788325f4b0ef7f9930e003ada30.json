It brought a whole new generation of fans into the Country Music/Bluegrass fold with it's first release in 1972. \n\n It all started when Earl and Louise Scruggs and family showed up for a Nashville NGDB show. Earl was impressed with the band's musical abilities and a friendship started. Four years later, Jeff Hanna and John McEuen of the NGDB went to see Earl perform and afterwards asked if he would do a project with them. The album concept took off from there. They asked Doc Watson to appear; telling him Earl Scruggs was planning on being a part of it. In an interview, Roy Acuff had made the statement, &quot;I'll play real country music anytime, anywhere, with anyone,&quot; and they took him up on that. You will hear these great artists along with Mother Maybelle Carter, Merle Travis, and many others adding their voices and picking skill to those of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. \n\nSong List:\n\n   1.

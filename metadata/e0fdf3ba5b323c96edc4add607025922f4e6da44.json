The first part was originally advertised as an &quot;ABC Family Original Movie&quot;, but nearly a year later, it was followed up with two other parts of equal length over the course of a weekend. Fallen stars Paul Wesley as Aaron Corbett, a good-natured high school student who discovers he is half-human/half-angel. The series inspired a reality game on abcfamily.com which won an interactive Emmy.&quot;\n\n\nI would prefer to buy these online somewhere, but I have not been able to find anywhere to do so, so if you know where these episodes might be purchased, please let me know.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0fdf3ba5b323c96edc4add607025922f4e6da44","amp;dn":"Fallen+%28ABC+Family+Miniseries%29+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0fdf3ba5b323c96edc4add607025922f4e6da44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,253,243,186,91,50,60,150,237,196,173,214,7,2,89,34,244,230,218,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

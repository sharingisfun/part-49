OAV and the first two episodes of the 2. one - as soon as there are some fansubs of the further episodes (and I find them) I&amp;#039;ll upload them as well.\n\nIf you just stumbled upon this: Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro chan is an anime with a rather random kind of humor. Basicilly the main joke is about the main character getting brutally killed and revived. If you do not want to download (yet) I&amp;#039;d recommend this site for streaming:- just search for it there.\n\nlast time i checked I couldn&amp;#039;t find the first episode with english subs anymore, though. Also on the site you can find many different languages subbed (spanish and german for example).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15689cd68672d18885e8bbbbc7fa5006b38bdd7f","amp;dn":"Bokusatsu+Tenshi+Complete+1.+OAV+%2B+Bokusatsu+Tenshi+2+1%2B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15689cd68672d18885e8bbbbc7fa5006b38bdd7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,104,156,214,134,114,209,136,133,232,187,187,199,250,80,6,179,139,221,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

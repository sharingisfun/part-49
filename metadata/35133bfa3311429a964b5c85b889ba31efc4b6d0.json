Michael Jordan opened the second overtime with an alley-oop dunk and Duke's Johnny Dawkins came back to cut the North Carolina lead to 82-81 with a short jumper but Duke would get only one more basket as Jordan and Perkins carried the Tar Heels to the victory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35133bfa3311429a964b5c85b889ba31efc4b6d0","amp;dn":"Rivalry.Series.UNC.vs.Duke.March.3.1984+%28DVD+Shrink+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35133bfa3311429a964b5c85b889ba31efc4b6d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,19,59,250,51,17,66,154,150,75,92,133,184,137,186,49,239,196,182,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

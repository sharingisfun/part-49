Travis Dane takes the train hostage and starts using the train as a\ncontrol center in his effort to take control of a top-secret government outer\nspace super-weapon. Dane built the weapon but was fired by the government\nbefore it was deployed. He has since hooked up with shadowy Middle Eastern\nterrorists who have offered him 1 billion dollars to use the satellite to blow\nup the Eastern seaboard by targeting a nuclear reactor that is located\nunderneath the Pentagon. Dane lets the Pentagon know that he's got control of\nthe weapon by using it to blow up a Chinese chemical plant. Officials can't\nstop him because they can't locate his headquarters.

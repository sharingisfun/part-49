A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 5: The Fight From Within\n\nDuring the war in the occupied Soviet Union, many oppressed Soviet citizens welcome Hitler, but their enthusiasm is short-lived as they discover his plans. The Partisan resistance begins without Stalin's support. Then, as he begins to accept the Partisans, he provides them with supplies.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e166ac9d0d2cbca1087b451eec661a83df8ecb","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e166ac9d0d2cbca1087b451eec661a83df8ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,225,102,172,157,13,44,188,161,8,123,69,30,236,102,26,131,223,142,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

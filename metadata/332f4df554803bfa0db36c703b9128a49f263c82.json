The band was formed in 1998 and is made up by a sextet Yohan Simeon (percussion), Frederik Juan (stand-up drumkit/percussions, respectively assorted percussion, marimba or vibraphone), Sylvan Bayol (Chapman Stick &amp; Warr Guitar), Dominic Leonetti (vocalist, lyricist and acoustic guitars), Claude Leonetti (La LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ode, a midi-electronic plug-guitar instrument), and GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ric Byar (guitar).\n\nIn their music, Lazuli do a relaxed blend of prog rock (classic, retro and modern spots altogether), instrumental songs and alternative/warm world music - the edge between pop and rock being a good one. Numb folk, heavy beats or rich samples are fairly used. Their artistic top quality is not so much the high-striking, elaborate or attractive tones and prog-generating sensations, as the inspired songs and instrumental intermissions (much of the songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ contrast being described in this way) marking a depth of music, a thoughtfulness (or, on the contrary, an irony) in writing and an experience full of brightness. Reflections, atmospheres and such various effects pass and go, but Lazuli's strong art can dwell on as ample.\n\n\n\nEn Avant Doute... (2007)\n\n01. En Avant Doute (3:02)\n02.

The script is used to identify the Kindle's internal ID number, which can be used to enable non-Amazon purchased books to work on the Kindle. '...this week we received a DMCA take-down notice from Amazon requesting the removal of the tool kindlepid.py and instructions for it. Although we never hosted this tool (contrary to their claim), nor believe that this tool is used to remove technological measures (contrary to their claim), we decided, due to the vagueness of the DMCA law and our intention to remain in good relation with Amazon, to voluntarily follow their request and remove links and detailed instructions related to it.' Ironically, the purpose of the script is to make the Kindle more useful to its users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f45f4874178c8728f2a9f768fa033fe88a16162","amp;dn":"azw-0.1.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f45f4874178c8728f2a9f768fa033fe88a16162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,69,244,135,65,120,200,114,143,42,159,118,143,160,51,254,136,161,97,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

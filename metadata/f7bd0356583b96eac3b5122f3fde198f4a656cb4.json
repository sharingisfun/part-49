You can also read the log file, which show the rip is done with the most possible quality.\nIf you convert it in wav with cuesheet, you can burn it with EAC and have the PERFECT copy of the original CD (also with pregaps within tracks).\nAnyway, this is the best way to archive audio cds, so I hope you will keep them seeding for a while.\n\nThey&amp;#039;re all original CDs. I will release remastered version later if this will be well seeded (Boy, October, War and Joshua Tree, all with bonus discs).\n\nI have low bandwidth (10-15 kb/s), thanks to my provider&amp;#039;s p2p filters...  so be patient.\n\nHere the album list:\n\n1980 - Boy\n1981 - October\n1983 - War\n1984 - The Unforgettable Fire\n1987 - The Joshua Tree\n1988 - Rattle And Hum\n1991 - Achtung Baby\n1993 - Zooropa\n1997 - Pop\n2000 - All That You Can&amp;#039;t Leave Behind\n2004 - How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy, help seeding... and consider to make high quality flac release as in this guides (sorry for the heavy png format):\n\nEAC settings:border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Image Hosted by\n\nmp3tag settings:border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Imageborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfinal proper release:border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Imageborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinally, here an example of an EAC log:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

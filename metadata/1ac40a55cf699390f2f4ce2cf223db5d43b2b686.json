Now you must take control of your ship and lead your crew to solve the mystery. Your mission is clear -- discover the cause of the devastating explosion and prevent it from happening again. During the race you will battle the Cardassians, ally with the Klingons, investigate the unpredictable Romulans and reveal a secret plot that threatens the Federation itself.\n\nThe excitement and the challenges grow as you and your crew race to find the cause through over 30 different missions. These will include many of Star Trek\\&amp;#039;s most fundamental elements - defense, combat, diplomacy, exploration, rescue, and scientific discovery. For the first time you will be able to command both Galaxy and Sovereign class ships much like the U.S.S. Enterprise-D and U.S.S. Enterprise-E.\n\nThe question is -- can you keep your cool while bulkheads fail? Will you save your crew, save the colonists and defend the Federation from a new threat?\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************\n\nInFo:\nPublisher: Activision\nDeveloper: Totally Games\nGenre: Space Combat Sim\nRelease Date: Feb 27, 2002\nESRB: EVERYONE\nGame Information\nNumber of Players: 1-8\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nWindows 95/98/ME/2000/xp \nSystem: PII 450 or equivalent\nRAM: 64 MB\nVideo Memory: 16 MB\nHard Drive Space: 650 MB\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************\n\nInstructions\n1.

The Man, the Mystery, the Legend \n\nThis remarkable film penetrates the myth surrounding the five time winner of the Tour de France, who &quot;did for cycling what Mozart did for music&quot; ! Anquetil was a prococious talent, inventing a new style - rounded, aerodynamic and apparently easy - that was ahead of its time. Anquetil elevated time-trialling to a new level and set the standard for his generation. \n\nIn addition to his many victories - Tour de France, Giro d&amp;#039;Italia, Classics - it was his courage and his persistence that we discover in this superbly made film. It portrays a wonderful athlete but a very mysterious man. Haunted by the spectre of lonliness and death, superstitious and shy, the five time Tour de France winner was also a hell-raiser and bon viveur. Unique in cycling he could party, drink champagne, wine and spirits and smoke all night and then win a race the following day. Carefully researched and full of valuable first-hand accounts, notably from his first wife Janine, this film provides a fascinating and very moving insight into the myth surrounding one of cycling&amp;#039;s greatest champions. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cc5a601ae938b2bce9417cab0c05277eeb2200","amp;dn":"Jacques+Anquetil+-+The+Man%2C+The+Mystery%2C+The+Legend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cc5a601ae938b2bce9417cab0c05277eeb2200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,204,90,96,26,233,56,178,188,233,65,124,171,12,5,39,126,235,34,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

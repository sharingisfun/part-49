Because they are American tourists and therefore &quot;above suspicion,&quot; they find themselves commissioned by the British secret service to gather the plans for a new secret weapon masterminded by the Nazis involving magnetic mines.\n\nIn Paris, Frances buys a hat decorated with a rose as a signal for their first contact, who silently instructs them to go to a cafÃƒÂ© in Montmartre. Another contact gives Frances a guide book to southern Germany and the couple notice a series of pinpricks on a map in the book, put together become the opening notes to the song &quot;My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose.&quot; The couple is to go to a bookshop in Salzburg, and the owner, A. Werner (Felix Bressart), informs them they must go to a certain museum. There, a tour guide named Hassert Seidel (Conrad Veidt) suggests that they check into a guest house run by Frau Kleist.\n\nSome days later, the couple intends to go to a performance of Franz Liszt, but are advised not to attend by Thornley (Bruce Lester), a fellow houseguest. They go anyway, and during the same loud passage that Thornley had been practicing earlier in the night, a Nazi colonel is shot and killed. Officials insist on questioning the entire audience, but Richard and Frances are rescued by Gestapo chief Count Sig von Aschenhausen (Basil Rathbone), a former Oxford schoolmate of Richard's. Later, Thornley admits to Richard that he killed the Nazi as revenge for torturing and killing his Austrian girlfriend.\n\nFrances and Richard go to the home of Dr. Mespelbrunn (Reginald Owen) but he does not seem to be there. Suddenly, They notice sheet music for &quot;My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose&quot; on his piano just as Sig appears. When Sig does not respond to a signal regarding a rose that Richard gives him, the couple becomes suspicious. They then hear thumping noises upstairs and discover that Sig is holding Mespelbrunn prisoner. Mespelbrunn tells them to run and that the Gestapo is coming after them. The couple leaves the house just in time, and Hassert appears and they free Mespelbrunn, and all four head for Innsbruck. Mespelbrunn later gives Richard a paper with the mine information.\n\nThe couple obtains passports from an elderly couple named Schultz, complete with forged identification. Richard is to head to Italy because his clothes as a priest are too conspicuous, but when the real Schultzes are arrested by the Gestapo, the police are on the lookout for them in disguise. Frances is detained and questioned by the Gestapo, but Thornley, who happens to be in Innsbruck as well, is able to find Richard. Richard, Thornley and Hassert sneak in to where Frances is being held and kill all her captors, however Thornley is also killed. After fooling the Nazi border guards, Hassert and the newlyweds finally find freedom.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 90 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 90 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8009679e267776532955adf137e9b4f0bb049673","amp;dn":"Above+Suspicion+%281943%29+DVD5+-+Joan+Crawford%2C+Fred+MacMurray+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8009679e267776532955adf137e9b4f0bb049673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,9,103,158,38,119,118,83,41,85,173,241,55,233,180,240,187,4,150,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

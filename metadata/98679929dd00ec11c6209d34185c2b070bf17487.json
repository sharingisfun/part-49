These networks share a peculiar geometry, finding a compromise between disorder and determinism, though some, like the hexagonal snowflake or the stones of the Devil's Causeway fall into a rigidly ordered structure. Branching networks are found at every level in biology - from the single cell to the ecosystem. Human-made networks too can come to share the same features, and if they don't, then it might be profitable to make them do so: nature's patterns tend to arise from economical solutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98679929dd00ec11c6209d34185c2b070bf17487","amp;dn":"Branches+-+Natures+Patterns%2C+A+Tapestry+in+Three+Parts+%28Nature+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98679929dd00ec11c6209d34185c2b070bf17487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,103,153,41,221,0,236,17,198,32,157,52,24,92,43,7,11,241,116,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

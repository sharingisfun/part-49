When it does arrive, it's usually an event based in evangelical preaching or infomercial hard selling. Back in the day though, it announced the arrival of a media experience unrivaled in the history of the locale. The limited engagement would set itself up within a theater or drive-in. Banners and flyers would adorn the city streets. Interviews and publicity stunts were staged. And when it was all over, when the singular production was completed and the last of the receipts tallied, the ballyhoo would be repacked and stored away in the trunk of a car or truck, ready to move on to the next venue.\n\nFrom the 1930s to 1970s, the traveling roadshow movie was a profitable foundation of the exploitation market. Usually offering a tame film with &quot;live child birth&quot; or &quot;sexual hygiene&quot; (or a combination of both) footage inserted into it, the combination con man/carnival barker movie promoter scoured the back water burgs of American looking for a location and lineup of fresh pigeons to pluck. The huckster would weave his way from town to town, territory to territory setting up his shop, preparing his &quot;medically approved&quot; hygiene and sex ed &quot;books&quot; for sale and publicizing the production with cheap but effective advertising campaigns, complete with sidewalk displays and in-theater gimmicks. Every movie guaranteed graphic scenes of actual childbirth and/or cases of venereal disease. And at a particular point during the film's running time, the projector would be stopped so that an &quot;expert&quot; in the movie's field could pitch a product for sale.\n\nIn the case of The Wrong Rut, the surreal cesarean sequence follows a formulaic melodrama in which our heroine, high school drop out Sally Kelton, carries on like a tween in the midst of a boy band bender. Taking in the act of miserable pianist Steve Ryan, she is instantly smitten. She pines for the cranky keyboardist though the only interest he seems to return derives directly from below his waist. When he prepares to leave for a gig in Capital City, Sally gets desperate. She gives up her virtue in a veiled attempt to keep her musician man. He leaves anyway, and when Sally is caught coming in late by her prudish parents, she decides to leave home. An overnight bus trip to her lover's lair leads to heartache, and Sally is left relying on a kind hearted wounded war vet gas station owner named Drew Baxter for support. Our petrol pumper gives Sally a job, treats her like a queen, and uses that most seductive of '40s/'50s aphrodisiacs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the model railroad setup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to win her over. But soon the pangs of pregnancy hit, and Sally senses she'll eventually become another 'with child' outcast. She ends up in a home for unwed mothers, and eventually gives up the kid for adoption. When Drew finds out, he is taken aback. Sally spirals into a world of motherhood mental illness, eventually attempting to baby-nap a toddler. Sadly, it seems that she'll be trapped in The Wrong Rut forever.\n \nAt the center of this scattered soap opera is poor sad Sally, played by the like named nobody Sally Forrest. A minor Miss in the history of cinema, Forrest would forge a decent career in '50s/'60s TV before dropping out of the business all together in the '70s. It's too bad that she didn't have more of a chance to showcase her performance mantle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she is sensational here, playing pie-eyed and pissed on with equal poignancy. During the final act, when she recognizes that giving up her baby was a mistake, her breakdown in the hospital offices is quite memorable. With her fragile china doll features and glamour gal gone to seed persona, we truly identify with this little lewd girl lost. While some of her reactions may be a bit unbelievable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she moons over the schlub Steve Ryan like he's the second coming of Thelonious Monk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but her moments with the decent Drew Baxter have a real tang of truth. Sadly, roadshow hack Jack Lake got his hands on the film, and befouled it by intercutting some pointless surgical shenanigans (what did the raincoat crowd want with a non-private parts delivery of a child?) and playing it in drive-ins for decades. What was surely an attempt at a decent, controversial drama became just another facet of the exploitation freak fest, along with the photocopied sex manual and the &quot;visiting doctor&quot; giving the mandatory intermission sales pitch.\n \nIn the '60s,Not Wanted was reissued as The Wrong Rut, with the addition of footage of a Caesarian birth &quot;borrowed&quot; from an educational film, and booked into drive-ins and grindhouses on the exploitation circuit.\n\nThis Caesarian section appears in this movie,weird!\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 796mb\nDuration.... 01:33:01\nCodec.......

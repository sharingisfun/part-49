A social encounter is, however, not only about negotiation or \ncontemplating existence, but is rather about what happens when people interact \nactively, when they involve themselves with people and materialities, when they \nmove around, fetch things, use things, leave things etc. The primary focus of the volume is the effects and processes involved in intra- and inter-societal encounters. All but one text in this volume were presented as working papers at sessions at the Xth and XIth European Association for Archaeologists Meetings in Lyon and Cork respectively\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n  \nChapter One \nEncounters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Materialities ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Confrontations: An Introduction \nPer Cornell &amp; Fredrik Fahlander\n \nChapter Two \nThird Space Encounters: Hybridity, Mimicry and Interstitial Practice \nFredrik Fahlander\n\nChapter Three \nMateriality, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AmbiguityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢  and the Unfamiliar in the Archaeology   \nof Inter-Societal Confrontations: A Case Study from Northwest Australia \nRodney Harrison \n \nChapter Four \nDawn of a New Age:  The Late Neolithic as Third Space \nJeanette Varberg \n \nChapter Five \nA Microarchaeological Approach  to the Social Significance  \nof Late Bronze Age Burial Practices:  Age and Gender  \nat the Lusatian Urnfield of Cottbus Alvensleben-Kaserne (Germany) \nAlexander Gramsch. \n \nChaper Six \nUnhomely Space:  Confronting Badiou and Bhabha \nPer Cornell \n \nChapter Seven \nEmptiness and Form:  A Microarchaeology of Buddhism \nLinus Hammarstrand \n \nChapter Eight \nKeeping up Appearances: On the Northern Frontier  \nin Scandinavian Funnel Beaker Times \nGunlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶g Graner &amp; Leif Karlenby\n\nChapter Nine \nLethal Encounters.

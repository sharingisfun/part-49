The irony of course is palpable, not only because a court which freely makes its proceedings available across the internet is being asked by the RIAA, in SONY BMG Music Entertainment v. Tenenbaum, to prevent the district court from making similar proceedings available across the internet, but also because the end product is an MP3 file which can be freely downloaded, shared by email, shared through p2p file sharing, and even 'remixed.' The legal arguments focused on relatively narrow issues: the interpretation of a rule enacted in the District Court of Massachusetts, and the legal effect of a resolution by the First Circuit Judicial Council, rather than on broader First Amendment grounds.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/09/2141231&amp;art_pos=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/09/2141231&amp;art_pos=3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18465d701f5476069f359ab9ba61c9b4bc2836d","amp;dn":"SONY+BMG+Music+Entertainment+v.+Tenenbaum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18465d701f5476069f359ab9ba61c9b4bc2836d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,132,101,215,1,245,71,96,105,243,89,171,155,166,28,155,75,194,131,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

For security reasons Barry never uses his real name, and calls him Ray Topham. Barry recruits a team of young wannabees. Their quest leads them to two of Rays associates; a local cocaine supplier and ex-S&amp;M porn actress called Joanne Miller, and the charmingly psychopathic Tommy Morghen who acts as Rays personal security consultant. They soon realise that Barry is out of his depth, and so they exploit him for their own purposes with both hilarious and tragic results. Diary of a Bad Lad explores themes of sex, drugs, violence, exploitation, and the desperate limits that people will go to in order to make a film.\n\nCats :\nJoe O'Byrne\t ... \tTommy Morghen\nPaul Birtwistle\t... \tBirty\nDonna Henry\t... \tJoanne Miller\nRoxanne Gregory\t... \tRoxy\nClive Bonelle\t... \tRichard\nJames Foster\t... \tSimon Huxley\nJonathan Williams\t... \tBarry Lick\nTim Paley\t... \tFrank\nChris Leonard\t... \tFace Slash Victim\nMichael Booth\t... \tMichael\nCharlie Anderson\t... \tCharlie\nBob Atkinson\t... \tHimself\nJason Blacow\t... \tJay\nAlison Booth\t... \tRays daughter\nLouise Brand\t... \tAnonymous Interviewee\nAlice Broadley\t... \tLady who discovers corpse\nTony Dowling\t... \tTony\nMargo Grimshaw\t... \tHerself\nBilly Hodge\t... \tBig Billy\nGerald Jackson\t... \tCorporate Video Narrator (voice)\nSam Kadir\t... \tDoorman\nCarolyn Mason\t... \tLeanne Huxley\nTom Miller\t... \tRay Topham\nMichael Nesdale\t... \tAirport manager\nNeil Procter\t... \tBarman\nElaine Richards\t... \tJule Topham\nLes Scott\t... \tHimself\nJohn Sturgess\t... \tGunman #1\nMick Tattersall\t... \tHimself\nMC Tunes\t... \tMC Tunes (as Nicky Lockett)\n\nData Technical :\nAudio.....: English\nSubtitles.: None\nVideo.....: XviD 640x352 25.00fps [Stream 00]\nAudio.....: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 127kbps [Stream 01]\n\nScreen :\n[img]http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/5600/diaryofabadlad2010scree.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc59d44e1398a0206b5e848eabb156bc030e85be","amp;dn":"Diary+Of+a+Bad+Lad+%2A2010%2A+%5BREADNFO.DVDRip.XviD-miguel%5D+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc59d44e1398a0206b5e848eabb156bc030e85be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,89,212,78,19,152,160,32,107,94,132,142,171,177,86,188,3,14,133,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

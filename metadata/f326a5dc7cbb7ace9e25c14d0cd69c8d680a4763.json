A film about human beauty in twelve chapters which tells the tales of people from Bombay, Mexico City, Moscow and New York, who are all struggling for survival, with ingenuity, intelligence and dignity. They all share the dream of a better life.\n\nMegacities is a great documentation. After I saw the film, I felt like when I saw movies like &quot;Koyaanisquatsi&quot; or &quot;Powaaquatsi&quot;. You can see and hear 12 different stories about people in big cities around the globe like Mexico, Moscow and New York. You see the poor people living in the slums, prostitutes and nude girls in peep shows, drug-dealers at there work, dealers and that kind of people. In very disturbing scenes you see dog-fights, chicken-farms, and whores, naked in their room. It lets you in a feeling like the thriller &quot;Seven&quot; did, with the only difference that this is real stuff. Everyone should see this movie or this kind of movies. It shows how bad mankind could be, but also what people do, when they have no money. And after the film you leave the cinema and feel shame, that you have a home, Tv-Set, Computer and enough to eat without thinking of the people, shown in this film. But if you think of it, how lucky we are, to be born in such a country like Austria, and what could had happen, if we were born in a poor country. Megacities is a great experience, nobody should miss.

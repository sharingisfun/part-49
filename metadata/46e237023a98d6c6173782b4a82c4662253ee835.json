In 1992 they produced a crossover of jazz, hardcore, and ambient, which they self described as an &quot;unholy ambient mixture of slow jazz ballads, Black Sabbath doom and down tuned Autopsy sounds&quot;. \n\nHenseleit left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Christoph ClÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ser in 1997, replacing the guitar with a saxophone at the same time.\n\nHomepage: http://www.bohrenundderclubofgore.de/\n\n\nAlbums:\n\n    * Gore Motel (1994)\n    * Midnight Radio (1995)\n    * Sunset Mission (2000)\n    * Black Earth (2002)\n    * Geisterfaust (2005)\n    * Dolores (2008)\n\n\nmp3, 128|175|320 mbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e237023a98d6c6173782b4a82c4662253ee835","amp;dn":"Bohren+%26+Der+Club+Of+Gore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e237023a98d6c6173782b4a82c4662253ee835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,226,55,2,58,152,214,198,23,55,130,180,168,44,70,98,37,62,232,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

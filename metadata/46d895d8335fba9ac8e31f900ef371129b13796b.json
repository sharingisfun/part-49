It chronicles World War I over eight episodes.\n\nEpisode 3: Total War\n\nBy 1915, the conflict had spread across boundaries between continents and peoples, becoming a global war--a fact grimly confirmed by the unlikely battle between Turks and Australians on the Turkish cliffs of Gallipoli. The Allied force eventually abandoned the assault with 46,000 dead. \n \nThis total war effected the lives of many different people: in some communities unprecedented casualty rates especially among young officers stripped young women of all their male contemporaries; West African soldiers were shipped in from the colonies to fight in the trenches; brave Englishwomen traded other jobs for more dangerous jobs in weapons factories. Everyone was affected. The first genocide of the 20th century -- the ultimate form of total war against civilians -- was also part of this conflict. Turkish ethnic cleansing practices killed more than a million Armenians. A practice later noted by Hitler when he remarked to his high command: &quot;Who remembers the Armenia massacres today?&quot;\n\n\nEpisode 4: Slaughter\n\nIn 1916, some of the most appalling battles in human history took place on the Western Front. The Battle of Verdun became for the French what Gettysburg is for Americans; Verdun symbolized for the French the strength and fortitude of their armed forces and the solidarity of the entire nation.\n \nThe goal of the German commander was not territory, but to bleed his enemy to death. The battle lasted nine months and in the end the front lines were nearly the same, while over 300,000 French and Germans were killed and over 750,000 were wounded. \n \nThe British offered the same unspeakable sacrifice at the river Somme, where another million died, and at Ypres [Passchendaele], in Belgium, a graveyard for half a million more. As the slaughter continued with no significant gains in territory by either side, the men in the trenches kept their sanity by using music, theater and trench newspapers to replicate the world they left behind.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/greatwar/chapters/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/greatwar/chapters/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46d895d8335fba9ac8e31f900ef371129b13796b","amp;dn":"The+Great+War+and+the+Shaping+of+the+20th+Century_episodes_3_and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46d895d8335fba9ac8e31f900ef371129b13796b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,216,149,216,51,95,186,154,200,227,31,144,14,243,113,18,155,19,121,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

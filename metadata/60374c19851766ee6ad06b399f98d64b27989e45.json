Originally titled Pokolenie, the film dissects the impact that World War II had on the youth of Poland. Tadevsz Lomnicki plays an impressionable young Warsaw resident who falls in love with resistance leader Ursula Modrzinska. The passion they feel towards their cause is inextricably entwined with the intensity of their feelings towards one another. During several crucial moments, the director contrasts the &quot;official&quot; version of wartime events with the actual facts (many experienced first-hand by Wajda), partly as a means of explaining the peacetime disillusionment of so many young Poles. As a result, the film was subject to an overabundance of government interference when it was first released. Watch closely in the Underground scenes of A Generation and you&amp;#039;ll spot a young Roman Polanski.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Pokolenie.(1954).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1113 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.6 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1027 Kbps\n      Width : 544 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.195\n      StreamSize : 641 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 78 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 48.4 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.93 \n      Encoding settings : VBR (rh)\n\nCriterion Collection rip\n\nIMDB: tt0048500\n\nPolish audio, English subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60374c19851766ee6ad06b399f98d64b27989e45","amp;dn":"wajda+-+a+generation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60374c19851766ee6ad06b399f98d64b27989e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,55,76,25,133,23,102,238,106,208,107,57,159,152,214,75,39,152,158,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

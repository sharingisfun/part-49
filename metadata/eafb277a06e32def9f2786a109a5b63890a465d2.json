I\\'ve needed the full ost of this game for so long and never being able to find it, after tracking down all the spc sound files, I proceeded to record 164 songs track after track to wav then converted all to mp3 sorted out the tracks and named each song. To say the least it was a time consuming process but worth so much seeing as I truly love this masterpiece of a game and the soundtrack that accompanies it. Originally composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu \\\\\\&quot;hip\\\\\\&quot; Tanaka. For all you Earthbound fans out there I hope you enjoy this, sounds gold all recorded in 320kbps mp3 format. I also tossed in some extras. \n\nI highly recommend the fan remix compilations like Bound Together http://www.wushuplaya.com/boundtogether/ and Rock Candy http://starmen.net/rockcandy/\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Three things are of the utmost importance: wisdom, courage, and friendship.\\\\\\&quot; - Buzz Buzz\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafb277a06e32def9f2786a109a5b63890a465d2","amp;dn":"Earthbound+%7E+Mother+2+-+Full+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafb277a06e32def9f2786a109a5b63890a465d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,251,39,122,6,227,45,239,159,39,134,161,9,165,182,56,144,164,101,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

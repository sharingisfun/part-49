Eric Kaz had written great love songs for Linda Ronstadt and Bonnie Raitt, and Craig Fuller was coming off his Top 40 hit &quot;Amie&quot; with Pure Prairie League. As it happened, Steve Katz&amp;#039;s &quot;Back In &amp;#039;57&quot; turned out to be one of the album&amp;#039;s highlights, but &quot;Let Me Down Easy,&quot; by Kaz And Fuller, was a minor hit, and there was also Kaz&amp;#039;s classic co-composition, &quot;Love Has No Pride.&quot; But those were just the cream of an excellent set produced by George Martin. Add it all up, and it should have meant more than a chart peak in the lower reaches of the Top 100, an early indication that, for whatever reasons, American Flyer was not destined to become the next Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ec9313fc6c7813a83ed007f5f7968b4324fc74","amp;dn":"American+Flyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ec9313fc6c7813a83ed007f5f7968b4324fc74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,236,147,19,252,108,120,19,168,62,208,7,245,247,150,139,67,36,252,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

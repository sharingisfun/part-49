Now don't get me wrong they are amazing albums, but I think that alot of the Chili Peppers creativeness comes from their older albums, especially The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. My two favorite songs on this album are Walkin' On Down The Road and Organic Anti-Beat Box Band. These songs show that this band doesn't think inside the box. They always do something entirely different and this album shows that. Like on the song Behind The Sun, Hillel plays the sitar and the song sounds INCREDIBLY COOL with it. And Flea is amazing throughout the entire album, especially on Skinny Sweaty Man and Love Trilogy. Anthony Kiedis' vocals show that you dont have stay within the limits of being a singer, and you can be totaly crazy and it sounds amazingly good, and it just goes so well with the song and style of music. Jack Irons style of drumming goes insanely well with Flea's bass style and it makes the songs sound really good. Overall this album is definitely one of the Chili Peppers most creative and inspirational albums ever. And if you seriously want to become a true fan of them, you better pick this album up. \n\nby FleaBassPlyr101 &quot;Joey&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Fight Like A Brave.wma                                      \n02 - Funky Crime.wma                                             \n03 - Me And My Friends.wma                                       \n04 - Backwoods.wma                                               \n05 - Skinny Sweet Man.wma                                        \n06 - Behind The Sun.wma                                          \n07 - Subterranean Homesick Blues.wma                             \n08 - Party On Your Pussy.wma                                     \n09 - No Chump Love Sucker.wma                                    \n10 - Walkin' On Down The Road.wma                                \n11 - Love Trilogy.wma                                            \n12 - Organic Anti-Beat Box Band.wma                              \n13 - Behind The Sun (Instrumental Demo).wma                      \n14 - Me And My Friends (Instrumental Demo).wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dec86e195eaf21b05be0707798a1ff87dca9a87","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+The+Uplift+Mofo+Party+%281987%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dec86e195eaf21b05be0707798a1ff87dca9a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,236,134,225,149,234,242,27,5,190,7,7,121,138,31,248,125,202,154,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

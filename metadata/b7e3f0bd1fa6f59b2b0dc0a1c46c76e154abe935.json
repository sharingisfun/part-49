Surprised  by  such  behaviour,  he  would   :\n :      hesitate for a fraction of a second. This  unbelievably  short  period   :\n :      of time meant the fine line between death and life. It  gave  way  for   :\n :      other arguments and we had full cartridges  of  them.  We  would  kill   :\n :      hundreds of enemies this way, leaving behind  dead  bodies,  with  the   :\n :      eyes telling the story of surprise and our smiling faces.                :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ By no means was it an ordinary war. Our foe  was  faceless,  bereft  of   :\n :      identity. The whole Vietnam was our enemy. Its climate, terrain,  mud,   :\n :      jungle, mosquitoes and short, weird inhabitants,  armed  with  Chinese   :\n :      weapons and unreal ideals.                                               :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ In terms  of  military  strength,  we  outpowered  the  enemy.

It   :\n :      is hard to imagine any army capable of defeating foe  who  is  nowhere   :\n :      and everywhere at the same time, foe who fights  on  his  own  ground,   :\n :      which for us was hostile, alien and hard to understand. With time,  we   :\n :      learnt some rules of that world,  we  grasped  the  gist  of  fighting   :\n :      there. However, it was primarily the fight for survival.                 :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the communists in Vietnam,  once  said:  you   :\n :      can kill ten of my men with the loss of just  one  of  yours,  but you   :\n :      will still lose, and I shall prevail. At the early stages  of  war  in   :\n :      Vietnam, we treated those words as  a  madman&amp;#039;s  babble.  Towards  the   :\n :      end, we had to acknowledge they were true.                               :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ In October 1967, having spent  some  time  training  at  a  school  for   :\n :      special forces in Nha Trang, I was transferred to a temporary military   :\n :      base in Don Dien, as the leader of a distant recon squad of four  men.   :\n :      We  all  had  been  in  service  for  long,   trained   in   sabotage,   :\n :      communication and intel. We were invisible  to  those  who  themselves   :\n :      tried to be invisible. We were the  assassins  of  killers.  Ready  to   :\n :      bite. Yet, the winter offensive of  North  Vietnam  army  smashed  our   :\n :      teeth.                                                                   :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ In 1968, a base located on the hill outside Don Dien  found  itself  on   :\n :      the marching route of a regular  communist  army,  preparing  for  the   :\n :      strike on the ancient, imperial city  of  Hue  -  the Binh  Tri  Thien   :\n :      province capital.                                                        :\n :                                                                               :\n :   ~ Al.

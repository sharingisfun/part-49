Here is how to download this song.\n\nStep 1 - You will need a program that is made for downloading torrents. \n         search Google for BitTorrent or uTorrent.\n\nStep 2 - Install the program.\n\nStep 3 - Click the Download This Torrent button and select OPEN.\n        (this doesn&amp;#039;t download the mp3 right away however it will open your torrent\n         program to start the download)\n\nStep 4 - Seeding - After the file is done downloading DON&amp;#039;T move it from it&amp;#039;s \n         current location or Stop/Pause the torrent and you will be seeding it.

However I can&amp;#039;t seem to buy it anywhere.

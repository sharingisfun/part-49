Since the death of his father, Maxime lives alone with his mother, whilst Esteban comes from a boisterous family of Spanish immigrants.   Nothing can separate the two spirited 13-year olds, or so they think.  EstebanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father Luis has found work in Spain and intends that his family return with him to his home country.  Maxime is stunned when he hears this news.  Esteban is more to him than a friend - he is his brother.

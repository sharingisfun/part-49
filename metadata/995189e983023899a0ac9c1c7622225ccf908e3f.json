Guide Rincewind wisely through the absurdly logical dialogs and puzzles the game is packed out with. The story includes wizards, dragons, time travels, custard, virgins.., just to give you an idea.\n\nReleased in 1996 by Psygnosys. PC Floppy, PC CD-ROM and Playstation versions are (better, were) available. The version your have downloaded is a multi-language version, speech in English (wonderfully voiced by Monty Python), subtitles in German, French, Italian and Spanish.\n\nHow to run it\n\nFirst of all decompress the 7z file using 7zip (it\\&amp;#039;s free, available at http://www.7-zip.org/). Burn the iso, you can use DVD-Decrypter for that (freeware, available at http://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/). Now, the nightmare begins, because if you use Windows XP, you won\\&amp;#039;t hear any sound out of the game. I recommend VDMSound (an emulator of old DOS-based sound cards) in order to hear something; there is a nice guide to this tool in Vogons Forum.\n\nEnjoy a great graphic adventure in its true form, not these Fahrenheit and Dreamfall rubbish they keep throwing at us nowadays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995189e983023899a0ac9c1c7622225ccf908e3f","amp;dn":"Discworld_PC-CD_eng_spa_ger_fr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995189e983023899a0ac9c1c7622225ccf908e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,81,137,233,131,2,56,153,160,172,156,28,118,34,34,92,207,144,142,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The most insatiably curious among us often have become scientists.\n\nThe scientists discussed in this book have shaped humankindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge and laid the foundation for virtually every scientific discipline, from basic biology to black holes. Some of these individuals were inclined to ponder questions about what was contained within the human body, while others were intrigued by celestial bodies. Their collective vision has been concentrated enough to examine microscopic particles and broad enough to unlock tremendous universal marvels such as gravity, relativity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even the nature of life itself. Acknowledgement of their importance comes from a variety of knowledgeable and well-respected sources; luminaries such as Isaac Asimov and noted biochemist Marcel Florkin have written biographies contained herein.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qYzWOWK1L._SS500_.jpg[/img]\n\n[b][quote][color=Navy]\n\nThe 100 Most Influential Women of All Time\n\nRosen Education Service \n2010 \nENGLISH\nISBN: 1615300104 \n359 pages \nPDF \n4.12 MB\n \nIt has been said that when it comes to success, it isn't what you know, but who you know.

Does it require that a person hold political office and rule masses? Does it include only those who made a positive impact on society or also those who wreaked devastation and destruction? Do humanitarians or activists who never held office but who had the ability to stir thousands and millions with a vision of a different, better world merit inclusion? Many very different types of leaders are profiled in this book, which is arranged chronologically by date of birth. It ends with Osama bin Laden and Barack Obama. One is a mastermind of terrorist acts that have killed thousands and another a politician who overcame the weight of hundreds of years of slavery and discrimination against blacks to become the first African American elected president of the most powerful country in the world. They are opposites in almost every imaginable way. Bin Laden leads a global jihad against Western values, and Obama, the symbolic leader of the West, was the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. They are linked, however, in their ability to inspire loyal followersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in bin LadenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s case to commit destruction and in ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to believe that ordinary citizens, acting together, can change a sometimes seemingly bleak world for the betterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and in their lasting impact on the world in which they and future generations will live. The world today has some 6.7 billion people, most of whom adhere to one religion or another. In the 13th century BCE, Moses delivered his people from Egyptian slavery and received the Ten Commandments, establishing Judaism as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first great monotheistic . Although Jews make up but a small fraction of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population today, monotheism flourishes, with and Muslims together accounting for more than half the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population.\n\nIntroduction 8 Moses 17 Buddha Gotama 19 Confucius 22 Alexander the Great 26 Shihuangdi 31 Julius Caesar 34 Cleopatra 39 Jesus Christ 42 Constantine I 46 Attila 49 Muhammad 52 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AlÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â« 55 Charlemagne 57 William I 63 Urban II 68 Saladin 71 Chinggis Khan 73 Hongwu 76 Joan of Arc 79 Martin Luther 81 Henry VIII 84 Elizabeth I 87 Tokugawa Ieyasu 91 Oliver Cromwell 93 Louis XIV 98 Peter I 102 Catherine II 105 George Washington 109 Thomas Jefferson 113 Maximilien de Robespierre 118 Napoleon I 120 SimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n BolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­var 126 Giuseppe Garibaldi 130\n\nAbraham Lincoln 133 Otto von Bismarck 142 Frederick Douglass 145 Victoria 148 Sitting Bull 152 Theodore Roosevelt 154 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 162 Vladimir Ilich Lenin 166 Sir Winston Churchill 170 Mohammed Ali Jinnah 176 Joseph Stalin 179 Ibn SaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«d 185 Kemal AtatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rk 187 Franklin D.

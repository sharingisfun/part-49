She served four years on \nCanada&amp;#039;s Supreme Court before Kofi Annan gave her another platform for her \nactivism and strong views of human rights.\n\nOur film catches up with Arbour one year into her new job. The genocide in \nDarfur rages on. In Congo, Uzbekistan, Chechnya and Colombia, warlords and \ntyrants persecute and plunder. The UN embodies humanity&amp;#039;s most noble sentiments \nbut when the politics get complex, as in Darfur, the world body is paralyzed, \nits legitimacy in question. In the meantime, innocent civilians, mainly women \nand children, are deprived of their dignity and of their most fundamental \nrights.\n\nArbour&amp;#039;s experience as War Crimes Prosecutor has given her a reputation for \ntoughness. Her new job description is more complex and far-reaching. As \nArbour tries to reform her office and the UN while herself under attack, the \ncrisis in Darfur deepens and the world demands action. Arbour is caught in \nthe crossfire between the best of our human intentions and the ugly reality \nof big-power politics. Her tenacity and strong moral sense, rooted in her \nCanadian heritage and strengthened by her previous work assignments, give us \nhope.\n\nThis film follows Arbour as she reflects, develops her strategies and organizes \nher troops and travels to places of crisis. The film also allows viewers to \nexperience from within the step-by-step process of her battle for human rights. \nThis vigorous and determined woman challenges each and every one of us with \nquestions on how to confront today&amp;#039;s human rights crises with compassion and \ndetermination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b4f6748ffa06152ec13c63e0e1d74dfe37bd8a","amp;dn":"Louise+Arbour+and+the+Battle+for+Human+Rights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b4f6748ffa06152ec13c63e0e1d74dfe37bd8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,180,246,116,143,250,6,21,46,193,60,99,224,225,215,77,254,55,189,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The doors shut, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trapped inside, and slowly one by one they start getting killed in increasingly gruesome ways. Eventually itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left to one man to save the day, rescue the woman, and make it out alive in order to enjoy his reward.\n\n\n\nBeing such an overused clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, it could be thought that by now, young women simply would not go into haunted mansions whose background includes swathes of the Russian military getting killed and then having their ears plastered on the walls. Apparently not - or so EnixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bloody FMV survival horror will lead you to believe.\n\n\n\nFMV games: loved by some, hated by many. Sitting alongside titles such as Ground Zero Texas and Psychic Detective, the FEAR [sic] takes the FMV genre in bold new directions. In the past, such games allowed for minimal choices before forcing the player to watch a pre-recorded cut scene, leading to understandable complaints of a lack of actual gameplay. Even overlaying basic shoot-em-ups onto the proceedings (Rebel Assault springs instantly to mind) couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remove the stigma that FMV games had received.TF thankfully attempts to change this by giving the player direct control of movement within the environment. Addressed by the NPCs only as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr CameraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, everything is viewed in first person with actual gameplay being very much like old dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, sans the random battles. Every angle of the house has been painstakingly filmed along with close-up views of important areas. Movement is done in great big strides, with ninety-degree-angled turns. Each and every step having been filmed in order to maintain coherence and fluidity. At each ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstanding zoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the player can choose to get a closer look at and examine detailed areas, for clues or valuable items such as keys.\n\n\n\nThe game mimics the tried and tested gameplay mechanics of Biohazard (over a dozen keys need to be found), even ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“borrowingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ puzzles such as playing a piano and retrieving a moon shaped medallion to advance. A wise move which helps to immerse survival horror fans more easily, though sadly does dampen the initial scare factor. The most common action, though, will be to talk to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fellow characters, in Japanese only, initiating a small, incomprehensible cut scene where they could be revealing either a red herring or merely complaining about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe FEAR!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ There is also a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpsychic flashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ability that depletes a large section of a slowly charging power bar. Activating this shows psychedelic imagery which hides clues about what to do next.The game comes on four full DVDs: presumably, much like the holy hand grenade of Antioch, three would be too few and five too many for the vast quantity of cut scenes on offer. Not surprising, since there has been minimal compression used - everything being beautifully full screen, high resolution and with barely any colour loss. This allows for detailed viewing of the depraved killings that take place. Overall everything has very high production values, avoiding the traps that many cheaply made FMV games of the past suffered from, such as poor acting and low quality special effects.There are a grand total of 1251 pre-recorded cut scenes to search for that, once viewed, can be watched again at the playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leisure via a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpecialsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ menu. This is the biggest draw for the game, lending it an almost Pokemon-like feeling, with you having to find and collect all the cut scenes and endings available. Any that have previously been viewed can be skipped at the press of a button, making searching for them a mostly painless process. Whilst movement is fully controlled, item usage sadly is not, with items automatically being used in the correct places should you have them. This slight oversight destroys any hope of puzzles being involved and involving, since while you can view items in your inventory, they are used automatically should the need arise. To add some needed diversity, the player is also presented with regular route-changing multiple choice questions, and even humourous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhorror quizzesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to participate in, complete with the actor doing impressions of his favourite monsters.Sadly though, for all that is on offer, it suffers from several major problems. For a start, the decision to limit the use of the psychic flash was pointless, since its usefulness is limited at best. Movement, though fluid, is also painfully slow, resulting in players feeling the urge to tape down the run button in order to achieve some semblance of speed. There is also the problem of the targeted demographic.\n\n\n\nFans of FMV games are few and far between to begin with, so it takes a very dedicated kind of player to sit through hours of Japanese film in order to collect all the gory cinemas. By their very nature, film-based games are all about the narrative and total immersion provided by life-like footage. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the innate joy to be had from watching and understanding recorded film, so being in a foreign language with no subtitles makes it unaccessible to all but native Japanese speakers. Though not difficult to complete, a great deal of the enjoyment will be lost. While many Japanese games can be reasonably understood with a working knowledge of the written language, nothing short of near fluency in the verbal comunication aspect of Japanese will help with TF. This jarring realisation helps to undermine the overall potential immersive gameplay on offer.Enjoyable mini features such as being able to read the original intended script, bloodied death notes and military science reports will also be lost to the average importer. Though the plot can be roughly worked out solely by viewing what happens, the only thing left to the game will be the desire to find all of the hidden death scenes, of which some are extremely visceral. This, though, panders more to one's baser instincts than actually inducing terror in the player. What began as an extremely niche title, is hurt further by the fact that only those with a strong grasp of the native language will gain any fulfilment from it. While there is fun to be had from playing through the game and watching the cinemas, a great deal of the time the player will be left wandering the haunted corridors, bored and waiting for the next cut scene to kick in. Which is a shame since, had it been translated, it would have been the pinnacle of FMV gaming.\n\ndownloaded from rarbg,com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3403499d38737c3cc5dd64c9f003ad8d029987d5","amp;dn":"The+Fear+JPN+ps2dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3403499d38737c3cc5dd64c9f003ad8d029987d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,3,73,157,56,115,124,60,197,221,100,201,240,3,173,141,2,153,135,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

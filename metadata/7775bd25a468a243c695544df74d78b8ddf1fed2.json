(Unlike i386, ppc wasn't affected at all by the rebuild, and x86_64 only slightly.)  I've posted this torrent anyway in order to have a complete set.\n*********************************************************************************\n\nFraction of full ISO size: 81.7%\napplydeltaiso's approximate running time (2-3 GHz CPU, 1-2 GiB RAM): 15 minutes\n\nThis deltaiso file allows one to generate the Fedora-11-i386-DVD.iso image if one already has the Fedora-10-i386-DVD.iso image (either as an ISO file, or on DVD).  This requires the applydeltaiso command, contained in the deltarpm package (available in the Fedora repos).  Using the ISO file, one runs\n\napplydeltaiso Fedora-10-i386-DVD.iso Fedora-10_11-i386-DVD.diso Fedora-11-i386-DVD.iso\n\nIf one has the DVD, just mount it and then run\n\napplydeltaiso /dev/dvd Fedora-10_11-i386-DVD.diso Fedora-11-i386-DVD.iso\n\nBefore downloading the deltaiso, make sure to have the correct, verified, input image.  The SHA1 for Fedora-10-i386-DVD.iso is\n\n086fd570518ac58d3966c43c1b6d146e38919d8d *Fedora-10-i386-DVD.iso\n\nas found in the readily available signed SHA1SUM file.  If it's on DVD, one can simply do a mediacheck.  After running applydeltaiso, verify the output image.  The SHA256 for Fedora-11-i386-DVD.iso is\n\n6e812e782e52b536c0307bb26b3c244e1c42b644235f5a4b242786b1ef375358 *Fedora-11-i386-DVD.iso\n\nas found in the signed Fedora-11-i386-CHECKSUM file (use sha256sum to compute).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7775bd25a468a243c695544df74d78b8ddf1fed2","amp;dn":"Deltaiso+for+Fedora+10+-%3E+Fedora+11+i386+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7775bd25a468a243c695544df74d78b8ddf1fed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,117,189,37,164,104,162,67,198,149,84,77,247,77,120,184,221,241,254,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

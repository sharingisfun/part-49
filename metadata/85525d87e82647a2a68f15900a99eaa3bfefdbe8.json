During the television broadcast of the 2005 Australian Film Institute Awards, Jepson was honoured among the roll call of performers to have passed away in the previous year.\n\nDespite an initially mixed critical reception to the show, it has recently begun to develop something of a cult following, due both to the success of Chris Lilley's We Can Be Heroes, and to repeats of the show, that have aired on Foxtel's The Comedy Channel, and, most recently, on the Seven Network that originally aired the show. Chris Lilley's character Mr G first appeared here, later appearing in Summer Heights High.\n\nA 2 DVD-set of the entire series (13 half-hour episodes) was released on DVD in Australia on 6 November 2006. The DVD included the so-called 'lost' final episode of the series, which had not aired on Australian television during the series' original run.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85525d87e82647a2a68f15900a99eaa3bfefdbe8","amp;dn":"Big+Bite+%282003%29+DVD+ISO+Files+%28Chris+Lilley%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85525d87e82647a2a68f15900a99eaa3bfefdbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,82,93,135,232,38,71,162,166,143,21,144,10,153,234,163,191,239,219,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

With Mason and Capaldi eager to form a new group, Winwood agreed to join the partnership along with Chris Wood and so the four members retreated to a secluded cottage in Aston Tirrold, Berkshire to rehearse and record their early work.\nTheir debut single was 1967's &quot;Paper Sun&quot;, a UK hit. &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, the second single, was an even bigger hit, and set the stage for a rivalry between Winwood and Mason, the group's principal songwriters. Their debut album was Mr. Fantasy which, like the singles, was a hit in the UK but not in the US or elsewhere. Their second album, Traffic, was released in 1968. The band began touring the US, but Mason was fired and Winwood announced the band's break-up. Winwood formed Blind Faith but after that band split in 1969 he began working on a solo recording which eventually turned into another Traffic album, John Barleycorn Must Die, their most successful album yet.\nAfter some personnel changes (including the return of Mason), Traffic released The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys, an American hit that didn't chart in the UK. Once again, personnel problems wracked the band as Capaldi began a solo career. Still, Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory was another hit, as was When the Eagle Flies (1974 in music). Capaldi's solo career began to heat up, and Winwood finally launched one of his own, recording the smash hit album Arc of a Diver. Winwood's solo career peaked with the album Back in the High Life. Traffic did not record again until 1994, when they released Far From Home. After re-uniting, Capaldi and Winwood toured widely but were unable to regain their former stature.\nTraffic was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2004. \n\n\n\nMr Fantasy (1967) UICY-93640 210MB\n\nMr. Fantasy is a fantastic piece of arty, psychedelic rock. Apart from the sitar-by-numbers of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Utterly SimpleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (George Harrison, it ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t) and the instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Giving to YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a winner. Even the bizarre, crowbarred-in psychedelic-pop of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“House For EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nProduced by Rolling Stones regular, Jimmy Miller, Mr. Fantasy kicks off in fine style with the dramatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Heaven is in Your MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and then slips effortlessly into the knockabout music hall sing-along of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Berkshire PoppiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, featuring the Small Faces on backing vocal and general horsing about duties. Elsewhere, the aching loss of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“No Face, No Name, No NumberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the titular phased and fuzzed-up freakout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Dear Mr. FantasyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the sinister ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DealerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, all score top marks.\n\nBy the time the album was released in December of 1967, Mason had left the band following internal strife regarding the direction they were taking - He was for the more whimsical approach as apparent on his songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“House For EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Utterly SimpleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hope I Never Find Me ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, whereas the rest of the band were pursuing a much harder edged sound. He rejoined in time for the second album, which rejected psychedelia in favour of a more mainstream, slightly progressive feel. A progressive feel that would bear fruit on the following two albums, John Barleycorn Must Die and The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys.\n\nThe Island remastered release of Mr. Fantasy also features a mono version of the original album with a slightly amended track listing and the singles, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Paper SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the LSD spiked imagery of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hole in my ShoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as bonus tracks.\n\nAll in all a solid blast of psychedelic rock, injected with a sense of a fun that was notably absent from later, more  serious Traffic recordings.\n\n\nEAC Read mode   : Secure with NO C2, accurate stream, disable cache\n\nMANY THX TO THE ORIGINAL RELEASER\n\n\n1.
